 
A Permuted Index for CSPICE APIs
===========================================================================
 
   This document is an index for NAIF's CSPICE functions. The index entries
   are short phrases that describe the functionality of the functions.
   Each phrase is followed by the name of the function that performs the
   described function.
 
   The reason we call this a ``permuted'' index is that each index
   entry occurs in multiple (cyclic) permutations, allowing each
   significant word in every functional description of a function to
   occur first in at least one index entry. For example, the function
   pxform_c (which returns the matrix that transforms position vectors
   from one specified frame to another at a specified epoch) can be
   found under the entries
 
      FIND a position transformation matrix                      pxform_c
      MATRIX, find a position transformation                     pxform_c
      POSITION transformation matrix, find a                     pxform_c
      TRANSFORMATION matrix, find a position                     pxform_c
 
   Some descriptions map to multiple functions; this happens when there
   are functions that perform the same function on different data
   types.
 
   This index is alphabetically ordered by the index entries.

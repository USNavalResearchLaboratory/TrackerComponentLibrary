Abstract
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   FRMDIFF is a program that samples orientation of a reference frame known
   to SPICE or computes differences between orientations of two reference
   frames known to SPICE, and either displays this orientation or these
   differences, or shows statistics about it or them.
 
 
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   FRMDIFF provides means for sampling orientation of a single reference
   frame, or for comparing orientations of two reference frames known to
   SPICE and supported by data from SPICE kernels.
 
   To sample orientation of a single frame the program computes a set of
   transformations from one frame (the ``from'' frame) to another frame
   (the ``to'' frame) over an interval of time with fixed or variable time
   step, using a given set of kernel files. Then, depending on the
   requested type of output report, it prints to the screen a table
   containing these transformations expressed as total rotation angles and
   axes, quaternions, matrices or Euler angles and angular velocities, or
   only magnitude of the maximum rotation and angular velocity, or results
   of a simple statistical analysis of rotations.
 
   To compare orientations of two frames the program computes a set of
   transformations from one frame (the ``from'' frame) to another frame
   (the ``to'' frame) over an interval of time with a fixed or variable
   time step using one set of kernels, computes a set of transformations
   for the same or a different ``from''-``to'' frame combination at the
   same times using the same or a different set of kernels, and then
   computes the difference in rotation and angular velocity between the
   corresponding transformations. Depending on the requested type of output
   report the program prints to the screen only maximum differences in
   rotation and angular velocity, or a complete table of rotation and
   angular velocity differences expressed as total rotation angles and
   axes, matrices, quaternions, or Euler angles, or results of a simple
   statistical analysis of the rotation differences.
 
 
If You Are in a Hurry
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   This section shows four very common FRMDIFF usage scenarios with just
   enough explanations to get you going. An extensive set of detailed
   examples is provided at the end of this User's Guide.
 
 
To Check if Two CK Files Provide Identical Data
 
   To check if two CK files containing orientation for the same structure
   with respect to the same reference frame provide identical data, run
   FRMDIFF as follows:
 
      % frmdiff -k <lsk> <sclk> <fk> -s <step> <ck1> <ck2>
 
   where ``<lsk>'', ``<sclk>'', ``<fk>'', ``<ck1>'' and ``<ck2>'' are the
   names of LSK, SCLK, FK, and two CK files (all five are required), and
   ``step'' is the time step, in seconds. If the maximum rotation angle in
   the output is zero (or close to zero, accounting for round off), then
   the CKs contain the same data. To include angular velocities in
   comparison, add ``-a yes'' before ``-s'', like this:
 
      % frmdiff -k <lsk> <sclk> <fk> -a yes -s <step> <ck1> <ck2>
 
 
To Assess Difference Between Two CK Files
 
   To assess the difference between two CK files containing orientation for
   the same structure with respect to the same reference frame as a
   function of time, run FRMDIFF as follows:
 
      % frmdiff -k <lsk> <sclk> <fk> -t dumpaa -s <step> <ck1> <ck2>
 
   where ``<lsk>'', ``<sclk>'', ``<fk>'', ``<ck1>'' and ``<ck2>'' are the
   names of LSK, SCLK, FK, and two CK files (all five are required); ``-t
   dumpaa'' sets the output format to the rotation angle and axis dump; and
   ``step'' is the time step, in seconds. The program's output, which can
   be rather lengthy, can be re-directed to a file using the ``>'' pipe.
   Using the data captured in the file the total rotation angle (column 2)
   can be plotted against TDB seconds (column 1) to analyze the difference.
   To print output time tags as UTC in ISO date format instead of TDB
   seconds, add
 
      -f 'YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND'
 
   before ``-k''. To use the Euler angle dump output instead of the
   rotation angle and axis dump output, replace ``dumpaa'' with ``dumpea''.
   To include angular velocities in the comparison, add ``-a yes'' before
   ``-s'', like this (the command line below is wrapped to fit the page
   width):
 
      % frmdiff -k <lsk> <sclk> <fk> -t dumpaa -a yes -s <step>
                <ck1> <ck2>
 
 
To Sample Quaternions from a CK File
 
   To sample orientation provided in a CK file and print it as SPICE-style
   quaternions, run FRMDIFF as follows:
 
      % frmdiff -k <lsk> <sclk> <fk> -t dumpqs -s <step> <ck>
 
   where ``<lsk>'', ``<sclk>'', ``<fk>'', and ``<ck>'' are the names of
   LSK, SCLK, FK, and CK files (all four are required); ``-t dumpqs'' sets
   the output format to the SPICE-style quaternion dump; and ``step'' is
   the time step, in seconds. The program's output can be re-directed to a
   file using the ``>'' pipe. To print output time tags as UTC in ISO date
   format, add
 
      -f 'YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND'
 
   before ``-k''. To use the ``other''-style quaternion dump instead of the
   SPICE-style quaternion dump, replace ``dumpqs'' with ``dumpqo''. To
   include angular velocities, add ``-a yes'' before ``-s''; to print
   angular velocities in the structure frame rather than the base frame,
   also add ``-m to'', like this (the command line below is wrapped to fit
   the page width):
 
      % frmdiff -k <lsk> <sclk> <fk> -t dumpqo -a yes -m to
                -s <step> <ck>
 
 
To Compute Transformation Between Two Frames
 
   To compute transformation from one frame known to SPICE to another frame
   known to SPICE and display this transformation as Euler angles, run
   FRMDIFF as follows (the command line below is wrapped to fit the page
   width):
 
      % frmdiff -k <kernels> -t dumpea
                -b <begintime> -e <endtime> -s <step>
                -f1 <from_frame> -t1 <to_frame>
 
   where ``<kernels>'' are the names of kernel files needed to compute the
   transformation (an LSK must be included); ``-t dumpea'' sets the output
   format to the Euler angles dump; ``<begintime>'' and ``<endtime>'' set
   the begin and end time, as UTC, for the period of interest; ``step'' is
   the time step, in seconds; and ``<from_frame>'' and ``<to_frame>'' are
   the names of the frames from which and to which the transformation can
   be computed. For lengthy reports the program's output should be
   re-directed to a file using the ``>'' pipe.
 
   Note that if the ``<to_frame>'' is a CK-based (Class 3) or PCK-based
   (Class 2) frame, the list of kernels (``<kernels>'') includes CKs or
   binary PCKs providing data for that frame, and ``-b <begintime> -e
   <endtime>'' are omitted, the program will automatically determine the
   ``<to_frame>''s data availability time window and will compute
   transformations with specified step over that whole window.

   FRMDIFF is a command line program with the following usage:
 
      % frmdiff [options] <first kernel> <second kernel>

      -x  <units for output angles>
      -d  <number of significant digits: 6 to 17 (default: 14)>
 
   The order of options and case of the option keys are not significant.
   The values provided after the option keys must be separated from keys by
   one or more spaces. Un-recognized options are not specifically checked
   for; instead they are treated as continuation of the value provided
   using the preceding recognized option.

                             only) primary kernel is a CK or a binary PCK,
                             class ID. If the second (or only) primary

                             Kernel names following ``-k2'' must be
                             separated by spaces.
 
         -b <time>           is used to specify the coverage window begin
                             time. This option must be provided when no

                             specified. The time string provided using this
                             option can be in any form accepted by SPICE's

                             transformation(s) must be computed. The number
                             must be an integer between 1 and 1,000,000.
                             The default value is 1000.
 
         -s <step>           is used to specify the step, in seconds, for
                             determining points within the coverage window,
                             for which the frame transformation(s) must be
                             computed. The step must be greater than 1E-8.
                             This option supersedes ``-n''.
 
         -t <report_type>    is used specify the type of report that the
                             program should display:
 
                                basic   to display only the maximum
                                        rotation angle and angular

         -a <av_flag>        is used to tell the program whether angular
                             velocities should be computed along with
                             rotations:
 
                                no      to compute only rotations
                                        (default)

                                from    to output angular velocities in
                                        ``from'' frame (default)

                             converting rotation matrices to Euler angles.
                             The value must be a space-delimited list of
                             three axes from the set of ``X'', ``Y'', ``Z''
                             (case-insensitive). The second axis must
                             differ from the first and third axes. The
                             default order is ``Z Y X''.
 
         -x <units>          is used to specify the units for the angles in
                             the rotation angle and axis dump (``-t
                             dumpaa'') and Euler angle dump (``-t dumpea'')

         -d <number>         is used to specify the number of significant

         -u                  causes the program to display the usage
                             message. This option overrides all other
                             options except ``-v''.
 
         -h                  causes the program to display a brief help
                             message. This option overrides all other
                             options except ``-v'' and ``-u''.
 
 
Inputs
===========================================================================
 
   For a successful run the program must be supplied with kernel files
   providing sufficient data to compute the frame transformation(s) of
   interest, and with control parameters clearly specifying, together with
   default values determined from the kernels, what transformations should
   be computed and at what times. Both the kernels and the control
   parameters are provided to the program using command line options.
 
 
Kernel Files
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In most cases one or more kernel files must be provided to the program
   to perform comparison or sampling of frame orientations. Depending on
   how the kernel files are provided, they fall into one of two categories
   -- primary kernel files and additional kernel files.
 
   Primary kernel files -- two, one, or none -- are provided at the end of
   the command line without any command line keys. Normally these kernel
   files contain orientations that differ (for example, predicted and
   reconstructed CKs for the same frame and time period, two versions of an
   FK with different alignment data for the same frame, etc.), or contain
   orientation to be sampled. These kernel files are also examined by the
   program to determine the default values for the ``from'', ``to'', and
   ``cov'' frames, and to determine the coverage window boundaries. Note
   that becasue the program slightly contracts coverage windows determined
   from CK files to compensate for roundoff occuring in SCLK to ET time
   conversions, in general FRMDIFF cannot be used to sample or compare CKs
   with discrete data, e.g. Type 1 CKs or Type 3 CKs with singleton
   intervals. For additional discussion of this limitation see the
   ``Coverage Window'' section below.
 
   Additional kernel files -- none, or as many as needed -- are provided
   anywhere on the command line (except at the very end) using the ``-k'',
   ``-k1'', and ``-k2'' keys. Normally these kernel files contain
   additional SPICE data needed to compute requested orientations (for
   example, LSK and SCLK files providing supporting time conversion data,
   FK files providing frame definitions needed by SPICE to recognize
   specified frames, etc).
 
 
Primary Kernel Files
 
   The primary kernels can be of any type -- CK, PCK, FK, SCLK, LSK or even
   SPK -- and are provided as the last or the last two items on the command
   line. Since the primary kernel files do not require specific command
   line keys, the program determines if they were given by examining the
   last two words on the command line as follows:
 
       --   If the last word on the command line is not the name of an
            existing file, the program assumes that no primary kernel files
            were given.
 
       --   If the last word on the command line is the name of an existing
            file but the second to last word is not, the program assumes
            that only one primary kernel was given.
 
       --   If both last two words are names of existing files, the program
            assumes that it was given two primary kernel files
 
   Due to the parsing approach described above, misspelling a primary
   kernel name leads to the program deciding that it either runs with no
   primary kernel files (if the last file name is misspelled) or that it
   runs with one primary kernel instead of two (if the second to last file
   name is misspelled). In either case, the misspelled file name(s) is(are)
   treated as a part of the value of the command line option immediately
   preceding it(them) causing the program to signal an error indicating an
   incorrect option value.
 
   On the other hand, if any of the options for specifying additional
   kernel files (``-k'', ``-k1'', ``-k2'') followed by actual files names
   is provided at the end of the command line (for the case of no primary
   kernels) or immediately preceding the only primary file (for one primary
   kernel case), the last one or the last two additional kernels are
   mistakenly picked as the primary kernel(s). In this situation the
   program usually signals an error indicating that orientation could not
   be computed because insufficient data was loaded.
 
 
Additional Kernel Files
 
   As for primary kernels, additional kernels can also be of any type --
   CK, PCK, FK, SCLK, LSK or even SPK. Unlike primary kernels, additional
   kernels are specified using the dedicated ``-k'', ``-k1'', and ``-k2''
   keys. Any number of additional kernels can be provided using any of the
   three keys, with kernel file names listed in any order, separated by
   blanks. While in some rare cases no additional kernel files are
   required, in most cases at least an LSK file and an SCLK file containing
   time correlation data and an FK file containing frame definitions should
   be specified using these keys. The additional kernels are used by the
   program as follows:
 
       --   All additional kernel files provided using the ``-k'' are
            loaded and used for both ``from''-``to'' frame combinations.
 
       --   All additional kernel files provided using ``-k1'' are loaded
            and used only for the first ``from''-``to'' frame combination.
 
       --   All additional kernel files provided using ``-k2'' are loaded
            and used only for the second ``from''-``to'' frame combination.
 
   Neither the combined set of additional kernel files given using
   ``-k''/``-k1'' nor the combined set of additional kernel files given
   using ``-k''/``-k2'' can contain enough data to compute corresponding
   orientations at any time in the time buffer without loading the
   corresponding primary file(s). If they do, the program signals an error.
   The two exceptions from this requirement are:
 
       --   when no primary kernel files are specified the additional
            kernel files given using ``-k''/``-k1'' and ``-k''/``-k2''
            should contain enough data to compute the corresponding
            orientations
 
       --   when both ``from'' and ``to'' frames in one or
            both``from''-``to'' frame pairs are built-in frames, the check
            for inability to compute orientations without loading primary
            kernel files is skipped
 
 
Comparison Runs vs. Sampling Runs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The program automatically decides whether it should compare two
   orientations or sample one orientation, based on the primary kernels
   provided at the end of the command line, additional kernel files
   provided using the ``-k1'' and ``-k2'' keys, and on the ``from'' and
   ``to'' frames specified on the command line using the ``-f1'', ``-t1'',
   ``-f2'', and ``-t2'' keys and/or determined from the primary kernel
   data.
 
   To run the program in comparison mode, it is enough to satisfy any of
   the following guidelines for specifying inputs that tell the program to
   compute two different orientations:
 
       --   provide two different primary kernels
 
       --   provide two different sets of orientation-specific additional
            kernels using ``-k1'' and ``-k2''
 
       --   specify two different ``from'' frames using ``-f1'' and ``-f2''
 
       --   specify two different ``to'' frames using ``-t1'' and ``-t2''
 
   To run the program in sampling mode, it is required to satisfy all of
   the following guidelines telling the program to compute a single
   orientation:
 
       --   provide only one primary kernel or no primary kernels
 
       --   provide no orientation-specific additional kernels using
            ``-k1'' and ``-k2''
 
       --   specify only one ``from'' frame using either ``-f1'' or ``-f2''
            or no ``from'' frames
 
       --   specify only one ``to'' frame using either ``-t1'' or ``-t2''
            or no ``to'' frames
 
   There are only two cases when the program runs in sampling mode after
   being given two primary kernels and/or two orientation-specific
   additional kernel sets. These cases are:
 
       --   When run with two primary kernel files, the program samples
            orientation only if these kernel files are the same file and
            additional kernel files provided using the ``-k1''/``-k2'' keys
            are the same files listed the same order and ``from'' frames
            provided using the ``-f1''/``-f2'' keys or determined
            automatically are the same and ``to'' frames provided using the
            ``-t1''/``-t2'' keys or determined automatically are the same.
 
       --   When run with one primary kernel file or no primary kernel
            files but with some orientation-specific additional kernels,
            the program will sample orientation only if additional kernel
            files provided using the ``-k1''/``-k2'' keys are the same
            files listed in the same order and the ``from'' frames provided
            using the ``-f1''/``-f2'' keys or determined automatically are
            the same frames and the ``to'' frames provided using the
            ``-t1''/``-t2'' keys or determined automatically are the same
            frames.
 
 
Runs with Two, One, and No Primary Kernel File(s)
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The number and types of primary kernel files and the mode in which the
   program is run (``comparing'' vs. ``sampling'') directly affect the
   requirements in regards to which command line options must be provided,
   approaches for determining default values for omitted options, and ways
   in which kernels are loaded and orientations are computed. The three
   subsections below discuss specifics of runs with two, one, and no
   primary kernel files.
 
 
Runs with Two Primary Kernel Files
 
   When two primary kernel files are provided on the command line:
 
       --   All ``-*1'' and ``-*2'' options, and ``-b'' and ``-e'' options
            can be omitted if one of the primary files (or both primary
            files) are a CK or a binary PCK, for which defaults for these
            options can be picked from the file(s).
 
       --   ``-f1'' or ``-f2'' or both, ``-t1'' or ``-t2'' or both, and
            sufficient coverage information (e.g. a sufficient combination
            of ``-b'', ``-e'', ``-c1'', and ``-c2'') must be specified if
            neither of the primary files is a CK or binary PCK because the
            program has no way of picking defaults for the ``from''
            frame(s), ``to'' frame(s), and time boundaries for any other
            types of primary kernels.
 
       --   If the program is run in comparison mode, the first primary
            file and the additional kernel files given using ``-k'' and
            ``-k1'' are loaded and orientations for the first
            default/specified ``from''-``to'' frame combination are
            computed at times within the default/specified time window,
            then the second primary file and the additional kernel files
            given using ``-k'' and ``-k2'' are loaded and orientations for
            the second default/specified ``from''-``to'' frame combination
            are computed at the same times within the default/specified
            time window, then the differences between the corresponding
            orientations are computed and printed in the specified format.
 
       --   If the program is run in sampling mode, the first primary file
            and the additional kernel files given using ``-k'' and ``-k1''
            are loaded and orientations for the first default/specified
            ``from''-``to'' frame combination are computed at times within
            the default/specified time window and printed in the specified
            format.
 
 
Runs with One Primary Kernel File
 
   When one primary kernel file is provided on the command line:
 
       --   All ``-*1'' and ``-*2'' options, and ``-b'' and ``-e'' options
            can be omitted if the primary file is a CK or a binary PCK, for
            which defaults for these options can be picked from the file.
 
       --   ``-f1'' or ``-f2'' or both, ``-t1'' or ``-t2'' or both, and
            sufficient coverage information (e.g. a sufficient combination
            of ``-b'', ``-e'', ``-c1'', and ``-c2'') must be specified if
            the primary file is not a CK or a binary PCK because the
            program has no way of picking defaults for the ``from''
            frame(s), ``to'' frame(s) and time boundaries for any other
            types of primary kernels.
 
       --   If the program is run in comparison mode, the primary file and
            the additional kernel files given using ``-k'' and ``-k1'' are
            loaded and orientations for the first ``from''-``to'' frame
            combination are computed at times within the default/specified
            time window, then the primary file and the additional kernel
            files given using ``-k'' and ``-k2'' are loaded and
            orientations for the second ``from''-``to'' frame combination
            are computed at the same times within the default/specified
            time window, then the differences between corresponding
            orientations are computed and printed in the specified format.
 
       --   If the program is run in sampling mode, the primary file and
            the additional kernel files given using ``-k'' and ``-k1'' are
            loaded and orientations for the first ``from''-``to'' frame
            combination are computed at times within the default/specified
            time window and then printed in the specified format.
 
 
Runs Without Primary Kernel Files
 
   When no primary kernel files are specified on the command line:
 
       --   ``-f1'' or ``-f2'' or both, ``-t1'' or ``-t2'' or both, and
            sufficient coverage information (e.g. a sufficient combination
            of ``-b'', ``-e'', ``-c1'', and ``-c2'') must be specified
            because the program has no way of picking defaults for the
            ``from'' frame(s), ``to'' frame(s), and time boundaries when it
            is not given any primary kernel(s) to examine.
 
       --   If the program is run in comparison mode, the additional kernel
            files given using ``-k'' and ``-k1'' are loaded and
            orientations for the first ``from''-``to'' frame combination
            are computed at times within the default/specified time window,
            then the additional kernel files given using ``-k'' and ``-k2''
            are loaded and orientations for the second ``from''-``to''
            frame combination are computed at the same times within the
            default/specified time window, then the differences between
            corresponding orientations are computed and printed in the
            specified format.
 
       --   If the program is run in sampling mode, the additional kernel
            files given using ``-k'' and ``-k1'' are loaded and
            orientations for the first ``from''-``to'' frame combination
            are computed at times within the default/specified time window
            and then printed in the specified format.
 
 
``From'', ``To'', and ``Coverage'' Frames
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The program has six command line keys -- ``-f1'', ``-t1'', ``-c1'',
   ``-f2'', ``-t2'', and ``-c2'' -- to specify frames to be used to compute
   rotations (``-f*'' and ``-t*'' keys) and to determine coverage from
   primary or additional CK or binary PCK files (``-c*'' keys). A single
   frame can be specified using each of these keys using the frame name,
   frame ID, or frame class ID (only for runs with primary kernel files
   that are CKs or binary PCKs).
 
   Whether the frame is specified by the name, ID, or class ID, it must be
   known to SPICE, i.e. it must either be a built-in frame or one of the
   frames defined in the FK file(s) provided as primary or additional
   kernels. If the frame name, ID, or class ID specified on the command
   line or picked from the primary file is not recognized after loading the
   kernel files provided using ``-k''/``-k1'' and the first primary file
   for the ``-*1'' frames, or provided using ``-k''/``-k2'' and the second
   primary file for the ``-*2'' frames, the program signals an error.
 
   Not all six frames have to be specified for every program run. In fact
   in many cases only one, two, or even no frames can be given and the
   program will set the rest to default values based on the other frames
   that are provided and/or by examining the primary kernel files. The
   three subsections below discuss specifying and picking defaults for the
   ``from'', ``to'', and ``coverage'' frames.
 
 
``From'' Frames
 
   The following rules apply to specifying and picking defaults for the
   ``from'' frames:
 
       --   If both ``-f1'' and ``-f2'' are specified, orientations are
            computed with respect to these ``from'' frames.
 
       --   If only ``-f1'' or only ``-f2'' is specified, the specified
            ``from'' frame is used for both ``from'' frames.
 
       --   If neither ``-f1'' nor ``-f2'' is specified and only one of the
            primary kernel files is a CK or a binary PCK, the ``from''
            frame from the last segment of this CK or PCK file is used for
            both ``from'' frames.
 
       --   If neither ``-f1'' nor ``-f2'' is specified and both primary
            kernel files are CKs or binary PCKs, the ``from'' frame from
            the last segment of the first primary CK or PCK file is used
            for both ``from'' frames.
 
       --   If neither ``-f1'' nor ``-f2'' is specified and no primary
            files are given or neither of the primary files is a CK or
            binary PCK, the program signals an error.
 
 
``To'' Frames
 
   The following rules apply to specifying and picking defaults for the
   ``to'' frames:
 
       --   If ``-t1'' and ``-t2'' are specified, orientations are computed
            for these ``to'' frames.
 
       --   If only ``-t1'' or only ``-t2'' is specified, the specified
            ``to'' frame is used for both ``to'' frames.
 
       --   If neither ``-t1'' nor ``-t2'' is specified and only one of the
            primary kernel files is a CK or a binary PCK, the frame from
            the last segment of this CK or PCK is used for both ``to''
            frames.
 
       --   If neither ``-t1'' nor ``-t2'' is specified and both primary
            kernel files are CKs or binary PCKs, the frame from the last
            segment of the first CK or PCK is used for both ``to'' frames.
 
       --   If neither ``-t1'' nor ``-t2'' is specified and no primary
            files are given or neither of the primary files is a CK or
            binary PCK, the program signals an error.
 
 
``Coverage'' Frames
 
   The following rules apply to specifying and picking defaults for the
   ``coverage'' frames:
 
       --   Only PCK-based (Class 2) or CK-based (Class 3) frames can be
            specified using ``-c1'' and ``-c2''. Specifying frames of any
            other class using these keys is an error.
 
       --   If ``-c1'' is not specified and the first ``to'' frame is a

            set to the first ``to'' frame. Similarly, if ``-c2'' is not
            specified and the second ``to'' frame is a PCK-based (Class 2)
            or CK-based (Class 3) specified using ``-t2'' or picked by
            default, the second ``coverage'' frame is set to the second

            used to look up the first coverage window from this primary
            file. Similarly, if ``-c2'' is specified or set by default to
            the second ``to'' frame, and the second (or only) primary
            kernel is a CK or binary PCK file containing data for this

            second coverage window from the kernels specified using ``-k''
            and ``-k2''.
 
 
Times for Comparison/Sampling
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The program picks times at which orientation(s) are computed based on
   the coverage window determined by examining the primary or additional
   files(s) and/or specified using the ``-b'' and ``-e'' keys, and on
   either the number of points within that window specified using the
   ``-n'' key or the time step specified using the ``-s'' key''.
 
   The coverage window begin and end times specified using the ``-b'' and
   ``-e'' options can be in any format accepted by SPICE's cspice_str2et
   function (see cspice_str2et header for details). If one or both of these
   times are provided, an LSK file must be provided as one of the
   additional or primary kernels.
 
   The number of points specified using the ``-n'' key must be an integer
   between 1 to 1,000,000 while the step specified using the ``-s'' key
   must be in seconds and be greater than 1.0E-8. If both ``-n'' and ``-s''
   are specified, ``-s'' takes precedence.
 
   The coverage window determined by examining the primary or additional
   kernels -- especially if these kernels are CK files, which frequently
   have gaps in coverage -- may consist of many intervals, some of which
   may be singletons (with the interval begin time equal to the interval
   end time). Whether the coverage window consists of only one interval or
   of many intervals, the program computes times within the window in such
   a way that the interval ends are always included in the set of points.
   The rest of times are distributed within the intervals, stepping from
   the beginning of each interval with the specified step. If the number of
   points is given instead of the step, the step is computed using the
   measure of the coverage window (the sum of the lengths of the individual
   intervals) and the specified number of points.
 
   Not all of the keys controlling selection of points have to be specified
   for every program run. In some cases none of these options are required;
   in the other cases ``-b'', ``-e'', ``-c1'', and/or ``-c2'' must be
   specified. The two subsections below discuss specifics of providing and
   picking defaults for the coverage window and step or number of points.
 
 
Coverage Window
 
   The program determines the coverage window either by examining the
   primary or additional kernels (resulting in the ``default coverage
   window''), or by using the begin and end times specified using the
   ``-b'' and ``-e'' keys, or as a combination of both.
 
   The default coverage window can be determined only from the primary or
   additional kernel files that are binary PCK files (using SPICE's
   cspice_pckcov function) or CK files (using SPICE's cspice_ckcov
   function) and only if these kernels contain data for the ``coverage''
   frames either specified using the ``-c1''/``-c2'' keys or set to default
   values as described earlier in this document. When both ``coverage''
   frames are specified or set to default values, the program determines
   the frame-specific coverage window for each of them using the
   corresponding primary or additional kernels and sets the default
   coverage window to the intersection of these two frame-specific coverage
   windows. When only one ``coverage'' frame is specified or set to the
   default value, the program determines the frame-specific coverage window
   for that frame using corresponding primary or additional kernels and
   sets the default coverage window to that frame-specific coverage window.
 
   In cases when a frame-specific coverage window is obtained from the
   corresponding primary kernel, the program examines only that primary
   kernel to construct the desired frame-specific coverage window. In cases
   when a frame-specific coverage window is obtained from additional
   kernels, the program examines all kernels of a particular type -- all
   CKs if the ``coverage'' frame is a CK-based frame or all binary PCKs if
   the ``coverage'' frame is a PCK-based frame -- listed explicitly with
   the ``-k''/``-k1'' or ``-k''/``-k2'' keys or included in meta-kernels
   provided with these keys and constructs the frame-specific coverage
   window as the union of coverages obtained from individual additional
   kernels.
 
   When the program determines the coverage window for a CK file it
   slightly contracts the actual coverage window given by the CK data to
   compensate for roundoff occuring in SCLK-ET time conversions. The
   contraction is done by adjusting inward the window interval boundary
   times by three times the amout of maximum roundoff that was determined
   by converting all boundary times from SCLK to ET then back to SCLK. This
   adjustment is done to ensure that the program is able to compute
   orientation at any time within the comparison or sampling time domain
   using the high level SPICE frames routines (cspice_pxform and
   cspice_sxform). While this contraction does not have any noticable
   effect when the program is run with CKs containing continuous data, it
   makes the program unuseable with CKs containing disrete data -- Type 1
   CKs and Type 3 CKs with singleton intervals -- because such contraction
   eliminates all singleton intervals corresponding to the discrete time
   point from the comparison window. The error messages that the program
   would display in such cases say that CK files do not provide any
   roundoff-adjusted coverage for a particular CK-based frame. An exception
   to this limitation is the rare ciscumstance when SCLK-ET time
   conversions have no round off; in such cases the program will work on
   CKs containing discrete data.
 
   If the default coverage window was determined from primary or additional
   kernel file(s) and either ``-b'' or ``-e'', or both ``-b'' and ``-e''
   were specified, it is truncated according to these begin and end times.
   If the time specified using ``-b'' is before the start of the default
   window, this time is ignored. If the time specified using ``-b'' is
   after the end of the default coverage window, the program signals an
   error. If the time specified using ``-e'' is after the end of the
   default window, this time is ignored. If the time specified using ``-e''
   is before the start of the default coverage window, the program signals
   an error.
 
   If no ``coverage'' frames are specified or set by default, or if one or
   both ``coverage'' frames are given but corresponding primary or
   additional kernels don't contain any data for them, both the coverage
   window begin time and the coverage window end time must be specified
   using the ``-b'' and ``-e'' keys because the program has no way to
   determining the default coverage window. If either ``-b'' or ``-e'' is
   not provided in such cases, the program signals an error.
 
 
Times within Coverage Window
 
   The program picks times within the coverage window based on the number
   of points specified using the ``-n'' key or the time step specified
   using the ``-s'' key''.
 
   When neither the number of points is specified using ``-n'' nor the step
   is specified using ``-s'', the number of points is set to a default
   value determined by examining the coverage window. If the total number
   of endpoints -- 2 for each non-singleton interval, 1 for each singleton
   interval -- for all intervals in the coverage window is greater than
   1000, the number of points is set to the number of endpoints and the
   step is not computed. Otherwise it is set to 1000 or a number less than
   but close to 1000 (the actual number is determined at run-time based on
   the lengths of the intervals) and the step is computed by dividing the
   measure of the coverage window by the number of points minus the number
   of endpoints.
 
   When the number of points is specified using ``-n'' but this number is
   less than the number of the coverage window interval endpoints, the
   value given using ``-n'' is ignored and the number of points is set to
   the number of interval endpoints and the step is not computed. Otherwise
   the number of points is set to the value provided using ``-n'' or a
   number less than but close to this value (the actual number is
   determined at run time based on the lengths of the intervals) and the
   step is computed by dividing the measure of the coverage window by the
   number of points minus the number of endpoints.
 
   When step is specified using ``-s'', the number of points is computed by
   adding the number of interval endpoints to the total of the numbers of
   points that can fit within each non-singleton interval when it's stepped
   through with this step. If the resultant number of points is greater
   than 1,000,000, the program signals an error.
 
   Whether the step was provided or computed using the provided or default
   number of points, the set of times at which orientation is computed
   includes all interval ends -- 2 for each non-singleton interval, 1 for
   each singleton interval -- plus additional points computed by stepping
   with this step within each non-singleton interval starting from the
   interval start time. The last point within each non-singleton interval
   is computed such that it always lies inside the 1.5*step to 0.5*step
   range off the interval end.
 
   Care should be taken when picking the step using ``-s'' or specifying
   the number of points using ``-n''. Picking a very small step for a large
   time window, or very many points for any window, leads to very long run
   times. In some cases the number of points computed using the step may
   even be greater that 1,000,000, preventing the program from running
   because its buffers are not large enough to deal with so many points. On
   the other hand, picking a large step or too few points prevents the
   program from doing a thorough comparison.
 
 
Angular Velocities
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The ``-a'' key is used to tell the program to compute angular velocities
   in addition to orientations. When the value provided using ``-a'' is
   ``yes'', the program computes angular velocities and reports them or
   their differences along with the orientation or orientation differences.
   If the key is omitted or set to ``no'', the program does not compute
   angular velocities. For any value other than ``yes'' or ``no'' the
   program reports an error.
 
   If the program samples or compares angular velocities (``-a yes''), the
   ``-m'' key is used to specify whether they or their differences should
   be reported in the ``from'' frame(s) or the ``to'' frame(s). When the
   value provided using the ``-m'' key is ``to'', the program reports
   angular velocities or their differences in the ``to'' frames. If the key
   is omitted or set to ``from'', the program reports angular velocities or
   their differences in the ``from'' frames. For any value other than
   ``to'' or ``from'' the program reports an error.
 
   In order for the program to compute angular velocities the data provided
   to it must support this computation. This is not an issue for any frames
   except for CK-based frames. Therefore, when using CK files, whether as
   primary or as additional kernels, it's important to make sure that these
   CKs include angular velocities before requesting the program to compute
   angular velocities.
 
 
Output
===========================================================================
 
   In a successful run the program prints to the screen a report consisting
   of the report header and report data. The report header provides the
   complete information about kernels and control parameters used by the
   program. The report data provides information about the orientation and
   angular velocity differences (for comparison runs) or orientations and
   angular velocities (for sampling reports) in a variety of ways, called
   report types. The algorithms used to compute orientations and angular
   velocities and their differences and to convert them to various
   representations used in the reports are shown in ``Appendix 1''.
 
 
Overview of Report Types
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The report data can be of one of the following types depending on the
   value provided using the ``-t'' key:
 
         basic    the basic report including only the maximum and the
                  average rotation angle difference (for comparison runs)
                  or rotation angle (for sampling runs) and, if requested,
                  the maximum and the average angular velocity magnitude
                  difference (for comparison runs) or angular velocity
                  magnitude (for sampling runs). This is the default report
                  displayed when ``-t'' is omitted.
 
         stats    the statistics report including a small set of
                  statistical information on the difference between two
                  frame orientations (for comparison runs) or statistics on
                  a single orientation (for sampling runs). In addition to
                  the items from the basic report (maximums and averages),
                  this report includes RMS of the rotation angle
                  difference/angle and angular velocity difference/angular
                  velocity and the times when the maximum value of the
                  rotation angle difference/angle and the angular velocity
                  difference/angular velocity were found.
 
         dumpaa   the angle and axis dump report containing a table listing
                  the orientation difference (for comparison runs) or
                  orientation (for sampling runs) expressed as the rotation
                  angle and axis and, if requested, the components and the
                  magnitude of the angular velocity difference (for
                  comparison runs) or angular velocity (for sampling runs),
                  along with the time, for each of the times at which the
                  orientations were computed.
 
         dumpm    the matrix dump report containing a table listing the
                  orientation difference (for comparison runs) or
                  orientation (for sampling runs) expressed as a 3x3
                  rotation matrix and, if requested, the components of the
                  angular velocity difference (for comparison runs) or
                  angular velocity (for sampling runs), along with the
                  time, for each of the times at which the orientations
                  were computed.
 
         dumpqs   the SPICE-style quaternion dump report containing a table
                  listing the orientation difference (for comparison runs)
                  or orientation (for sampling runs) expressed as a
                  SPICE-style quaternion and, if requested, the components
                  of the angular velocity difference (for comparison runs)
                  or angular velocity (for sampling runs), along with the
                  time, for each of the times at which the orientations
                  were computed.
 
         dumpqo   produces the ``other''-style quaternion dump report
                  containing a table listing the orientation difference
                  (for comparison runs) or orientation (for sampling runs)
                  expressed as SPICE-style quaternion and, if requested,
                  the components of the angular velocity difference (for
                  comparison runs) or angular velocity (for sampling runs),
                  along with the time, for each of the times at which the
                  orientations were computed.
 
         dumpea   the Euler angle dump report containing a table listing
                  the orientation difference (for comparison runs) or
                  orientation (for sampling runs) expressed as three Euler
                  angles and, if requested, the components of the angular
                  velocity difference (for comparison runs) or angular
                  velocity (for sampling runs), along with the time, for
                  each of the times at which the orientations were
                  computed.
 
         dumpc    the coverage intervals dump report containing a table
                  listing the start and stop times and durations for the
                  intervals inside the coverage window, during which
                  orientation(s) can be computed.
 
         dumpg    the coverage gaps dump report containing a table listing
                  the start and stop times and duration for the gaps inside
                  the coverage window, during which orientation(s) cannot
                  be computed.
 
   The ``basic'' and ``stats'' report are useful for quick assessment of
   whether and by how much two frame transformations differ (for comparison
   runs) or of the maximum/average magnitude of one frame transformation
   (for sampling runs). The ``dumpaa'', ``dumpm'', ``dumpqs'', ``dumpqo'',
   and ``dumpea'' are useful to capture detailed information about
   differences of two transformations (in comparison runs) or information
   about a single transformation (for sampling runs) in various formats as
   a function of time, for analysis or use in other applications. The
   ``dumpc'' and ``dumpg'' reports are useful for CK or binary PCK coverage
   overlap analysis.
 
   All reports have rigid formats. The only items in the reports that can
   be altered by command line options are:
 
       --   the format of time tags in all ``dump*'' reports; the time
            format is changed using the ``-f'' key
 
       --   the number of significant digits in the output numeric times
            (TDB seconds past J2000, decimal SCLKs and encoded SCLK ticks)
            and rotation component values or rotation difference component
            values included in all ``dump*'' reports; the number of
            significant digits is changed using the ``-d'' key
 
       --   units for the angles in the dump reports that include angles
            (``dumpaa'' and ``dumpea''); the units are changed using the
            ``-x'' key
 
       --   the order of rotations in the Euler angles dump report
            (``dumpea''); the order is changed using the ``-o'' key
 
       --   absence or presence of angular velocities in all non-coverage
            related dump reports (``dumpaa'', ``dumpm'', ``dumpqs'',
            ``dumpqo'', and ``dumpea''); whether angular velocities are
            included or not is controlled by the ``-a'' key as discussed
            earlier in this document.
 
 
Time Tag Format for ``dump*'' Reports
 
   The format of the time tags in the ``dump*'' reports is controlled using
   the ``-f'' key. The following values can be provided using ``-f'':
 
         et         to display times as TDB seconds past J2000 (default
                    format when ``-f'' is omitted)
 
         sclk       to display times as string SCLKs
 
         sclkd      to display times as decimal SCLKs
 
         ticks      to display times as encoded SCLK ticks
 
         <PICTUR>   a time format picture acceptable for cspice_timout
                    function. For example:
 
                       YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND    for UTC ISO date
                       YYYY-DOYTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND      for UTC ISO DOY
                       JULIAND.######### ::TDB          for Julian day TDB
 
   When one of the SCLK formats (``sclk'', ``sclkd'', ``ticks'') is
   specified, TDB times used internally by the program are converted to
   SCLK times using the SCLK ID associated with one of the ``to'' or
   ``coverage'' CK-based frames in the following priority order (from
   highest to lowest): first ``to'' frame, first ``coverage'' frame, second
   ``to'' frame, second ``coverage'' frame. If neither of the ``to'' or
   ``coverage'' frames is a CK frame, the program signals an error.
 
   When decimal SCLK tags are requested, the SCLK string returned by
   SPICE's cspice_sce2s function is converted to ``decimal'' SCLK by
   stripping off the partition, using the left field as the integer part
   and converting the rest of the fields to the decimal fraction of the
   left field using the SCLK field values from the string SCLK and SCLK
   moduli and offsets from the SCLK kernel file. For example, the SCLK
   string ``1/883612839.255'' that has seconds in the left field and a
   count of ticks having duration of 1/256 of a second in the right field
   is converted to this DP SCLK 883612839.996094. This conversion is
   supported only for type 1 clocks.
 
   When one of the numeric formats (``et'', ``sclkd'', ``ticks'') is
   specified, times are displayed in the scientific format with 14
   significant digits (e.g. +1.2345678901234E+01), unless ``-d'' is used to
   specify a different number of significant digits.
 
   ``-f'' does not apply to times in the report header and the statistics
   report, in which the times are always displayed as TDBs in calendar and
   seconds past J2000 numeric (in scientific format with 14 significant
   digits) formats.
 
 
Numeric Format for ``dump*'' Reports
 
   The default format of numeric time tags (TDB seconds past J2000, decimal
   SCLKs and encoded SCLK ticks), rotation and angular velocity component
   values, and rotation and angular velocity difference component values in
   all ``dump*'' reports is the scientific format with 14 significant
   digits (e.g. +1.2345678901234E+01). A different number of significant
   digits can be specified using the ``-d'' option as an integer in the
   range from 6 to 17. If specified, the number of significant digits is
   used for all numeric items in the ``dump*'' report data part (table) but
   is not used for any numbers in the table header or in the data part of
   the non-``dump*'' (``basic'' and ``stats'') reports.
 
   The default format, with 14 significant digits, is usually adequate for
   output from all comparison runs and from all sampling runs that are
   intended to produce tables of rotations or rotation differences for
   plotting but, due to round off, it may not be adequate for sampling runs
   that are intended to generate tables of quaternions, angles, or matrices
   for subsequent interpolation or packaging into CK files. For such
   outputs the number of significant digits should be increased to 16 -- if
   output rotations are planned to be packaged into an CK file using the
   MSOPCK program that employs a custom parser to ingest input numeric data
   -- or 17 -- if output rotations will read by an application that uses
   language-native means to parse input numeric data.
 
 
Angle Units for ``dumpaa'' and ``dumpea'' Reports
 
   The angles in the ``dumpaa'' and ``dumpea'' reports can be displayed
   using one of the following units depending on the value provided using
   the ``-x'' key:
 
                       radians (default)
                       degrees
                       arcminutes
                       arcseconds
                       hourangle
                       minuteangle
                       secondangle
 
   ``-f'' applies neither to the angles in the basic and statistics reports
   (in which the angles are always displayed in radians) nor to angular
   velocities in any reports (which are always displayed in radians per
   second).
 
 
Report Header
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The top portion of each report generated by the program is occupied by
   the report header providing complete information about the kernels and
   control parameters used by the program. The format and the set of
   information provided in the report header depends on
 
       --   the type of run (comparison vs. sampling)
 
       --   the type of report (data dump, coverage dump, etc.)
 
       --   the set of kernels that were provided
 
       --   whether angular velocities were computed
 
       --   and various miscellaneous control parameters.
 
   All lines in the report header have
 
      #
 
   as the first character. This allows common plotting programs, such as
   GNUPLOT, to skip these header lines when plotting the ``dump''-type
   reports generated by the program.
 
 
Report Header for Comparing Two Orientations
 
   For runs comparing two orientations the report header has the following
   format (the line numbers given on the left are not present in the actual

Report Formats
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Basic Report (no ``-t'' or ``-t basic'')
 
   The basic report indicates if the two frame transformations are
   different, or if a single transformation is a non-zero transformation,
   by displaying only the maximum and the average rotation angle difference
   (for comparison runs) or rotation angle (for sampling runs) and, if
   requested using the ``-a'' key, the maximum and the average angular
   velocity magnitude difference (for comparison runs) or angular velocity
   magnitude (for sampling runs).
 
   The basic report has the following format:
 
 
      Absolute difference magnitudes:
 
                                          maximum             average
 
        Rotation (rad):                  MAX_ANGLE         AVERAGE_ANGLE
        Angular Velocity (rad/s):        MAX_RATE          AVERAGE_RATE
 
 
   where:
 
       --   ``MAX_ANGLE'', ``AVERAGE_ANGLE'', ``MAX_RATE'',
            ``AVERAGE_RATE'' are the maximum and average rotation angle
            difference (for comparison runs) or angle (for sampling runs)
            and angular velocity difference (for comparison runs) or
            angular velocity magnitude (for sampling runs) determined for
            the set of frame transformation differences or frame
            transformations computed by the program within the coverage
            window.

Statistics Report (``-t stats'')
 
   The statistics report provides a small set of statistical information on
   the difference of two frame transformations (for comparison runs) or a
   single transformation (for sampling runs). It includes the same items as
   the basic report (maximums and averages) plus a few additional
   parameters such as RMS of the rotation angle difference/angle and
   angular velocity difference/angular velocity and the times when the
   maximum value of the rotation angle difference/angle and angular
   velocity difference/angular velocity were found.
 
   The statistics report has the following format:
 
 
      1) Average difference
 
         1a) Rotation (rad):                               AVERAGE_ANGLE
 
         1b) Angular velocity (rad/s):                     AVERAGE_RATE
 
 
      2) RMS of difference
 
         2a) Rotation (rad):                               RMS_OF_ANGLE
 
         2b) Angular velocity (rad/s):                     RMS_OF_RATE
 
 
      3) Maximum rotation difference
 
         3a) Rotation (rad):                               MAX_ANGLE

            magnitude (for sampling runs) determined for the set of frame
            transformation differences or frame transformations computed by
            the program within the coverage window. ``TDB_SECONDS'' and
            ``YYYY-MON-DD-HR:MN:SC.MMM'' are the times, as TDB seconds past
            J2000 and TDB in calendar date format, when the maximums were
            found.
 
       --   The word ``difference'' is omitted from the lines starting with

Examples
===========================================================================
 
   The examples below illustrate some of the common FRMDIFF usage
   scenarios. In all examples the files are assumed to be in the current
   directory, the FRMDIFF command lines, which usually occupy a single
   line, span multiple lines and use the UNIX shell style continuation
   character (backslash), and the report lines are truncated to fit the
   width of the page (``...'' at the end of a line indicates that it was
   truncated).
 
 
Checking if Two CKs Provide the Same Orientation
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to check if the daily reconstructed
   MRO CK ``mro_sc_2009-01-26.bc'' and the weekly reconstructed MRO CK
   ``mro_sc_psp_090120_090126.bc'' provide the same data. The CK files are
   provided as primary kernels to make the program run in comparison mode.
   The LSK ``naif0009.tls'' and SCLK ``MRO_SCLKSCET.00027.tsc'', required
   to support time conversions, and the FK ``mro_v13.tf'', required because
   it defines the MRO spacecraft frame and the frame used as the base frame
   in the CKs, apply to both CKs and, therefore, are provided using the
   ``-k'' key. To make sure the comparison is thorough the step is set to 1
   second using the ``-s'' key. No other options need to be specified
   because the primary kernels are CKs, which the program can examine to
   automatically pick the ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the coverage
   window. The basic report displaying the maximum difference will suffice
   for this case; therefore, there is no need to specify the ``-t'' option.

   The zero maximum rotation difference indicates that these two CKs
   provide the same data.
 
 
Comparing Predicted and Reconstructed CKs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to assess, for a specified period of
   time, the difference of the spacecraft orientation provided by the
   predicted CASSINI spacecraft CK ``09009_09025pa_fsiv_lud2.bc'' and the
   reconstructed CASSINI spacecraft CK ``09006_09011ra.bc''. The CK files
   are provided as primary kernels to make the program run in comparison
   mode. The LSK ``naif0009.tls'' and the SCLK ``cas00130.tsc'', required
   to support time conversions, and the FK ``cas_v40.tf'', required because
   it defines the CASSINI spacecraft frame, apply to both CKs and,
   therefore, are provided using the ``-k'' key. The angle and axis dump
   report is requested using ``-t dumpaa'' and the step is set to 10
   seconds using ``-s 10''. The time boundaries for the period of interest
   are specified using ``-b'' and ``-e''. No other options need to be
   specified because the primary kernels are CKs, which the program can
   examine to automatically pick the ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the
   default coverage window (which is intersected with the window of
   interest specified using ``-b'' and ``-e''). The program's output is
   re-directed to the file ``output.txt'' using the ``>'' shell pipe, with
   the contents of the file shown using the UNIX ``cat'' command.

   The orientation difference expressed as the rotation angle (column 2)
   can be plotted against TDB seconds (column 1) for analysis.
 
   Note that the time window shown in the report header is different from
   the requested window specified using the ``-b'' and ``-e'' options. The
   reason for that is the lack of coverage for the requested windows in one
   of the CKs (``09009_09025pa_fsiv_lud2.bc'').
 
   To find out when the difference between two orientations is the greatest
   without plotting the difference as suggested above, the program can be
   re-run with the same options to generate a statistics report (``-t
   stats''). For such a run it makes sense to also decrease the time step
   in order to determine the time of interest more accurately, for example
   by setting the step to 1 second (``-s 1'').

Comparing Orientations from a CK Read Using Different SCLKs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to assess the effect that using an
   out-of-date SCLK kernel has on the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft
   orientation computed from the M01 CK file ``m01_sc_2009-01-27.bc''. To
   make the program run in comparison mode, the current SCLK
   ``ORB1_SCLKSCET.00157.tsc'' and the out-of-date SCLK
   ``ORB1_SCLKSCET.00147.tsc'' are provided using the ``-k1'' and ``-k2''
   keys while the CK is provided as the only primary kernel.
   (Alternatively, the SCLK kernels could be provided as two primary
   kernels while the CK could be provided using the ``-k'' key, in which
   case the ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the coverage boundaries would
   have to be specified because the program would not be able to determine
   defaults from the SCLK kernels.) The LSK ``naif0009.tls'', required to
   support time conversions, and the FK ``m01_v28.tf'', required because it
   defines the M01 spacecraft frame, are provided using the ``-k'' key. The
   angle and axis dump report is requested using ``-t dumpaa'' and the step
   size is set to 10 seconds using ``-s 10''. No other options need to be
   specified because the primary kernel is a CK, which the program can
   examine to automatically pick the ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the
   default coverage window. The program's output is re-directed to the file
   ``output.txt'' using the ``>'' shell pipe, with the contents of the file
   shown using the UNIX ``cat'' command.

Comparing Binary and Text PCKs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to compare Earth orientations
   provided by the high precision Earth orientation binary PCK file
   ``earth_000101_090421_090128.bpc'' and the low precision Earth
   orientation text PCK file ``pck00008.tpc''. The PCK files are specified
   as two primary kernels to make the program run in comparison mode. For
   this run both ``to'' frames must be specified because the frame
   associated with the high precision orientation -- ``ITRF93'' -- is
   different from the frame associated with the low precision orientation
   -- ``IAU_EARTH''. These two frames are provided using the ``-t1'' and
   ``-t2'' keys. Note that neither the coverage boundaries nor the ``from''
   frames need to be specified because the program can set them to default
   values obtained by examining the binary PCK. The step is set to 1 hour
   (``-s 3600'') and the report type is picked to be the Euler angle dump
   (``-t dumpea'') with the rotation axis order Z,Y,X (``-o z y x'').
   Reporting differences as Euler angles might be desirable in this case
   because the angles will show how much of the difference is in the pole
   tilt (combination of angles about X and Y) and how much of it is in the
   rotation about the pole (angle about Z). The ``-x'' option used to
   report angles in degrees (``-x degrees''). The program's output is
   re-directed to the file ``output.txt'' using the ``>'' shell pipe, with
   the contents of the file shown using the UNIX ``cat'' command.

Comparing Two Text PCKs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to compare Mars orientations provided
   by the text PCK file ``pck00006.tpc'' containing 1994 IAU constants and
   the text PCK ``pck00008.tpc'' containing IAU 2000 constants. The PCK
   files are specified as two primary kernels to make the program run in
   comparison mode. Since both files are neither CKs nor binary PCKs, the
   ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the time boundaries for coverage window
   must be specified using the ``-t1'' (or ``-t2''), ``-f1'' (or ``-f2''),
   and ``-b'' and ``-e'' keys. Since the time boundaries are provided on
   the command line, the LSK ``naif0009.tls'' required for time conversions
   must be provided using ``-k'' (either ``-k1'' or ``-k2'' can also be
   used). The step is set to 1 hour (``-s 3600'') and the report type is
   picked to be the Euler angles dump (``-t dumpea'') with the rotation
   axis order Z,Y,X (``-o z y x''). Reporting differences as Euler angles
   might be desirable in this case because the angles will show how much of
   the difference is in the pole tilt (combination of angles about X and Y)
   and how much of it is in the rotation about the pole (angle about Z).
   The ``-x'' option is used to report angles in degrees (``-x degrees'').
   The ``-f'' option is used to print times as UTC in ISO date format (``-f
   YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC ::RND''). The program's output is re-directed to the
   file ``output.txt'' using the ``>'' shell pipe, with the contents of the
   file shown using the UNIX ``cat'' command.

Sampling Orientation from a CK
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to sample the orientation and angular
   velocity of Deep Impact Flyby (DIF) spacecraft from the daily CK
   ``dif_sc_2009-01-27.bc'' every five seconds over the whole period
   covered by the file and and print the orientation as engineering style
   quaternions and angular velocities expressed in the spacecraft frame,
   tagged with DP SCLKs. In addition to the CK file the LSK
   ``naif0009.tls'' and SCLK ``DIF_SCLKSCET.00036.tsc'', required to
   support time conversions, and the FK ``di_v17.tf'', required because it
   defines the DIF spacecraft frame, must be provided to the program. The
   CK file is provided as the only primary kernel and all other kernels are
   provided using ``-k'' to make the program run in sampling mode. The step
   is set to 5 seconds using ``-s 5''. The report type is set to the
   ``other''-style quaternion dump using ``-t dumpqo''. The output time
   format is set to DP SCLK using ``-f sclkd''. ``-a yes'' and ``-m to''
   are specified to add angular velocities rotated to the spacecraft frame
   (the ``to'' frame) to the output. No other options need to be specified
   because the primary kernel is a CK, which the program can examine to
   automatically pick the ``from'' and ``to'' frames and the coverage
   window. The program's output is re-directed to the file ``output.txt''
   using the ``>'' shell pipe, with the contents of the file shown using
   the UNIX ``cat'' command.

   In this example the program is run to print the rotation from the
   ``J2000'' frame to the ``ECLIPJ2000'' frame, both of which are built-in
   frames. To get this rotation, ``J2000'' is specified using ``-f1'' and
   ``ECLIPJ2000'' is specified using ``-t1''. While it may seem that no
   kernels would be needed in this case, it is not true. An LSK must be
   provided to the program because the time at which the orientation should
   be computed must be provided on the command line twice using the ``-b''
   and ``-e'' keys and this time has to be converted to TDB inside the
   program. Therefore the program is given the LSK ``naif0009.tls'' using
   the ``-k'' option and an arbitrary time (``2000-01-01'') twice using the
   ``-b'' and ``-e'' options. The Euler angle dump report is picked using
   ``-t dump'' with the axis order X,Y,Z picked using ``-o x y z''. The
   angles are requested to be printed in degrees using ``-x degrees''.

Sampling Orientation of a Dynamic Frame
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to sample orientation of the
   Geocentric Solar Ecliptic frame (``GSE''), a dynamic frame defined in
   the FK ``RSSD0002.TF'', relative to the ``J2000'' inertial frame and
   print this orientation as Euler angles tagged with Julian day TDB. The
   frames are specified using ``-f1'' and ``-t1''. All kernels needed to
   compute this transformation and convert times -- the FK, LSK
   ``NAIF0009.TLS'' and SPK ``DE405.BSP'' -- are listed using the ``-k''
   key. Since there are no primary kernels, the default coverage window
   cannot be picked automatically. Therefore the coverage window boundaries
   are specified using ``-b'' and ``-e''. The step is set to 1 day using
   ``-s 86400''. The Euler angles dump report is requested using ``-t
   dumpea''. The time format for output is set to be the Julian day TDB
   using
 
      -f 'JULIAND.######### ::TDB''
 
   The program's output is re-directed to the file ``output.txt'' using the
   ``>'' shell pipe, with the contents of the file shown using the UNIX
   ``cat'' command.

Sampling Orientation With Two Different ``Coverage'' Frames
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to sample orientation of the MGS MAG
   +Y sensor frame, ``MGS_MAG_+Y_SENSOR'', relative to the ``J2000''
   inertial frame over two hour period from 2006-04-01 11:00 to 2006-04-01
   13:00 (given using ``-b'' and ``-e'') and print this orientation as
   Euler angles tagged with UTC in ISO-date format. The ``from'' and ``to''
   frames are specified using ``-f1'' and ``-t1''. All kernels needed to
   compute this transformation and convert times are listed in the
   meta-kernel ``mgs_2006_v01.tm'' from the MGS SPICE PDS data set,
   specified using the ``-k'' key. Because computing this orientation
   requires data from MGS solar array CKs and spacecraft CKs, both of which
   have gaps in coverage, ``-c1'' and ``-c2'' are used to tell the program
   to look up available coverages for the frames ``MGS_LEFT_SOLAR_ARRAY''
   and ``MGS_SPACECRAFT'' associated with data in these CKs and intersect
   this available coverage with the requested two hour interval to
   guarantee that the program won't stop from not being able to compute
   orientation in one of the gaps. The step is set to 1 minute using ``-s
   60''. The Euler angles dump report is requested using ``-t dumpea''. The
   time format for output is set to be the UTC in ISO-date format using
 
      -f  'YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND'
 
   The program's output is re-directed to the file ``output.txt'' using the
   ``>'' shell pipe, with the contents of the file shown using the UNIX
   ``cat'' command.

Displaying Overlap in Coverage between Two CKs
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to determine the time intervals when
   both the MRO spacecraft CK ``mro_sc_psp_080408_080414.bc'' and MRO CRISM
   instrument CK ``mro_crm_psp_080413_080430.bc'' provide coverage and to
   display the boundaries of these intervals as UTC in ISO DOY format. The
   CKs are provided as the two primary kernels with other kernels -- the
   LSK ``naif0009.tls'' and the SCLK ``MRO_SCLKSCET.00027.65536.tsc'',
   required for time conversions, and the MRO FK ``mro_v13.tf'', defining
   frames used in the CKs, -- provided using ``-k''. The report is set to
   the coverage intervals dump using ``-t dumpc'' and the output time
   format is set to UTC in ISO DOY format using
 
      -f 'YYYY-DOYTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND'
 
   For runs like this usually both ``from'' frames and both ``to'' frames
   should be specified using ``-f1'', ``-f2'', ``-t1'', and ``-t2'' and
   these frames should match the base and structure frames from the CK
   files (the names of the base and structure frames can be seen in the CK
   summary produced by the ``BRIEF'' utility program run using the ``-rel
   -n'' options).

Displaying Gaps in a CK File
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   In this example the program is run to display the gaps in the CASSINI CK
   ``09006_09011ra.bc''. The CK is given as the only primary kernel, with
   all other kernels -- the LSK ``naif0009.tls'' and the SCLK
   ``cas00130.tsc'', required for time conversions, and the CASSINI FK
   ``cas_v40.tf'', defining frames used in the CK, -- provided using
   ``-k''. The report type is set to the coverage gaps dump using ``-t
   dumpg'' and the output time format is set to UTC in ISO date format
   using
 
      -f 'YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND'
 
   There is no need to specify the ``to'' and ``from'' frames because the
   program will pick them automatically by examining the CK file.
 
      % frmdiff -k naif0009.tls cas00130.tsc cas_v40.tf \
                -t dumpg -f 'YYYY-MM-DDTHR:MN:SC.### ::RND' \

Miscellaneous Things to Consider
===========================================================================
 
 
``Apples vs. Oranges''
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Even though the program has the flexibility to compare any two
   transformations -- for example the transformation from the ``J2000''
   frame to the ``IAU_MARS'' frame with the transformation from the
   ``MRO_SPACECRAFT'' frame to the ``MRO_CTX'' frame -- it doesn't mean
   that such comparisons make sense. In general, it makes sense to compare
   only transformations that are close to each other and have the same
   ``from'' frame.
 
 
Using Euler Angles for Small Rotation Differences
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   While Euler angles included in the Euler angles dump report (``-t
   dumpea'') may be one of the more intuitive representations of rotations,
   in many cases, depending on the rotation order, the angle magnitudes can
   be large and not representative of the small rotation differences. The
   total rotation angle provided in the rotation angle and axis report
   (``-t dumpaa'') is a much more reliable indicator of the difference of
   two rotations.
 
 
Single Epoch
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Due to the algorithm which the program uses to determine the coverage
   window, when orientations must be compared at, or an orientation must be
   sampled at, a certain epoch this epoch must be provided on the command
   line twice, once using the ``-b'' key and once using the ``-e'' key.

Computing Rotation and Angular Velocity Difference
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   When run in comparison mode the program uses the following SPICE
   routines to compute the rotation and angular velocity differences at
   each of the times:
 
       --   if only rotations (without angular velocities) are to be
            compared:
 
               M1 = cspice_pxform ( FROM1, TO1, ET )
               M2 = cspice_pxform ( FROM2, TO2, ET )
 
               MDIFF = M1 * M2'
 
       --   if rotations and angular velocities in the ``from'' frames are
            to be compared:
 
               X1          = cspice_sxform ( FROM1, TO1, ET )
               [ M1, AV1 ] = cspice_xf2rav ( X1 )
 
               X2          = cspice_sxform ( FROM2, TO2, ET )
               [ M2, AV2 ] = cspice_xf2rav ( X2 )
 
               MDIFF  = M1 * M2'
               AVDIFF = AV1 - AV2
 
       --   if rotations and angular velocities in the ``to'' frames are to
            be compared:
 
               X1          = cspice_sxform ( FROM1, TO1, ET )
               [ M1, AV1 ] = cspice_xf2rav ( X1 )
 
               X2          = cspice_sxform ( FROM2, TO2, ET )
               [ M2, AV2 ] = cspice_xf2rav ( X2 )
 
               MDIFF    = M1 * M2'
               AVDIFFFR = AV1 - AV2
 
               AVDIFF   = M1 * AVDIFFFR
 
   where FROM1, FROM2, TO1, TO2, and ET are the ``from'' and ``to'' frames
   of interest and time, MDIFF and AVDIFF are the rotation and angular
   velocity differences to be reported.
 
 
Sampling Rotation and Angular Velocity
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   When run in sampling mode the program uses the following SPICE routines
   to compute the rotation and angular velocity at each of the times:
 
       --   if only rotation (without angular) velocity is to be sampled:
 
               MDIFF = cspice_pxform ( FROM, TO, ET )
 
       --   if rotation and angular velocity in the ``from'' frame is to be
            sampled:
 
               X                 = cspice_sxform ( FROM, TO, ET )
               [ MDIFF, AVDIFF ] = cspice_xf2rav ( X )
 
       --   if rotation and angular velocity in the ``to'' frame is to be
            sampled:
 
               X             = cspice_sxform ( FROM, TO, ET )
               [ MDIFF, AV ] = cspice_xf2rav ( X )
 
               AVDIFF = MDIFF * AV
 
   where FROM, TO, and ET are the ``from'' and ``to'' frames of interest
   and time, MDIFF and AVDIFF are the rotation and angular velocity to be
   reported.
 
 
Converting Rotation to Angle/Axis
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   If no ``-t'' is specified, or if ``-t basic'', ``-t stats'', or ``-t
   dumpaa'' is specified, the program converts MDIFF to the rotation angle
   and axis using
 
               [ AXIS, ANGLE ] = cspice_raxisa ( MDIFF )
 
 
Converting Rotation to SPICE-Style Quaternion
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   If ``-t dumpqs'' is specified, the program converts MDIFF to the
   SPICE-style quaternion using
 
               QS = cspice_m2q ( MDIFF )
 
 
Converting Rotation to ``Other''-Style quaternion
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   If ``-t dumpqo'' is specified, the program converts MDIFF to the
   ``other''-style quaternion using
 
               QS = cspice_m2q ( MDIFF )
               QO(1) = -QS(2)
               QO(2) = -QS(3)
               QO(3) = -QS(4)
               QO(4) =  QS(1)
 
 
Converting Rotation to Euler Angles
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   If ``-t'' dumpea is specified, the program converts MDIFF to Euler
   angles using
 
               [ANG3, ANG2, ANG1] = ...
                               cspice_m2eul( MDIFF, AXIS3, AXIS2, AXIS1 )
 
   where AXIS1-3 are either defaults (``Z Y X'') or the axes specified
   using the ``-o'' key. The axes are ``passed'' as input to M2EUL in the
   same order as they are listed using ``-o''. For example, for ``-o X Z
   Y'' M2EUL is called with ``( MDIFF, 1, 3, 2, ...)''.

Abstract
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   MKSPK is a program that creates an SPK file from a text file containing
   trajectory information.
 
 
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   MKSPK is a NAIF Toolkit utility program that generates a new, or appends
   data to an existing, spacecraft or target body's ephemeris file in SPICE
   SPK format using one of the following SPK types: 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13,
   15, 17. This SPK file is a binary file constructed according to the
   SPICE DAF (Double Precision Array File) architecture, containing one or
   more SPK data segments.
 
   The MKSPK program accepts one ASCII text file containing descriptions of
   input data (setup file) and a second ASCII text file (input file)
   containing the source ephemeris data to be processed.
 
   Source ephemeris data can be time ordered lists of states (positions and
   velocities), sets of conic elements, sets of two-line elements, or a
   single set of equinoctial elements. All input data must be defined in a
   reference frame and relative to a body center both of which are
   specified in the setup file.
 
   The program allows the user to optionally specify some descriptive text
   in a separate file (comment file) to be placed into the ``comment area''
   of the SPK ephemeris file. (Doing this is highly recommended.)
 
   For archival documentation purposes the content of the MKSPK setup file
   is automatically placed at the end of the ``comment area'' of the SPK
   file.
 
 
Usage
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Program usage:
 
         > mkspk [-setup <setup file name>]
                 [-input <input data file name>]
                 [-output <output SPK file name>]
                 [-append]
                 [-u|-usage]
                 [-h|-help]
                 [-t|-template] [<input data type> <output spk type>]
 
   Command lines options can be provided in any order. Option keys must be
   strictly lowercase.
 
 
Setup, Input, and Output File Options
 
   If a setup file name isn't provided on the command line using the -setup
   key, the program will prompt for it. It will not prompt for the input or
   output file names -- these must be provided on the command line using
   the -input and -output keys or using the setup file keywords. If input
   and output file names are provided on the command line, any file names
   assigned using setup file keywords are ignored.
 
   The input file must already exist.
 
   The output must not exist unless the -append key or the corresponding
   setup file keyword tells the program to run in the append mode.
 
 
Append Option
 
   If the -append key or the corresponding setup file keyword is not
   specified, the output file must not exist prior to running the program.
 
   If the -append key or the corresponding setup file keyword is provided
   and the SPK file specified after the -output key exists, then new data
   will be appended to it.
 
   If the -append key or the corresponding setup file keyword is provided
   but the SPK file specified after the -output key doesn't exist, then a
   new SPK file with the name specified after the -output key will be
   created.
 
   Caution: if the program fails for any reason, it, in most cases, deletes
   the output file, even if it was appending data to an existing SPK file.
   Therefore, users should always make a backup copy of an SPK file to
   which new data is going to be appended before running the program in
   append mode.
 
   Also, the program cannot append data to an existing SPK file if its
   format is not native to the platform on which the program is running.
   Refer to the CONVERT User's Guide (convert.ug) for details.
 
 
Information Options
 
   If one of the information keys -- -u, -usage, -h, or -help -- is
   specified the program displays requested information, ignores all file
   options, and exits.
 
   If -u or -usage is speficied, the program displays the usage
   information.
 
   If -h or -help is speficied, the program displays a brief summary of its
   functionality.
 
 
Setup File Template Options
 
   If -t or -template is specified by itself or followed by an input data
   type/output SPK type combination, the program displays either the
   complete setup file template or a type-specific setup file template,
   ignores all file options, and exits.
 
   If -t or -template is specified by itself, the program displays the
   complete setup file template including all required, optional, and
   conditional setup file keywords. Since the total number of recognized
   setup keywords is rather large and some of the keywords are specific for
   just one input data type or output SPK type, using this complete
   template as the starting point in creating a setup for the case at hand
   may be cumberssome and inefficient.
 
   To display a more concise, type-specific template, the input data type
   -- ``states'', ``elements'', ``eq_elements'', or ``tl_elements'' -- and
   the output SPK type -- 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, or 17 -- can be
   specified following the -t or -template key. Such templates will include
   only keywords applicable for the specified type combination.
 
   For example, to display a template with keywords applicable to creating
   a type 13 SPK file from a table of states, use this option:
 
         > mkspk -t states 13
 
   To display a template with keywords applicable to creating a type 10 SPK
   file from a table of two-line elements, use this option:
 
         > mkspk -t tl_elements 10
 
 
Execution of MKSPK
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   You will need a setup file to execute the MKSPK utility program. The
   format for the setup file is described below.
 
   As it executes, the program will display a brief summary of its action.
 
   Only one SPK ephemeris file using a single SPK type and containing one
   or more segments may be generated during a single MKSPK session.
 
 
Setup File Format and Contents
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Other than the input and output file names, which may occur on the
   command line, the program requires all inputs such as object and body
   names or ID, frame name or ID, types of input and output data, list and
   order of input parameters, constants, etc. to be provided in a setup
   file. The format of this file must conform to the SPICE text kernel
   specification since the data from the setup file will be loaded into a
   kernel pool. This means that input values must be assigned to keyword
   variables using the format
 
         KEYWORD = VALUE
 
   Each assignment is restricted to a single line. Sets of these
   assignments must be enclosed between
 
         \begindata
         \begintext
 
   tokens, each of which must also be placed on a line by itself. Free-form
   descriptive/explanatory text may occur after the
 
         \begintext
 
   token. Still more assignments could follow another
 
         \begindata
 
   token.
 
   The names of the setup file keywords must be strictly uppercase while
   the standard value of keywords may be upper, lower or mixed case. Any
   white space preceding or following keyword names, values and equal sign
   is ignored.
 
   All character string values and time strings must be enclosed in single
   quotes, provided on a single line and be no longer than 80 characters.
   When multiple value are allowed and used, enclose the complete set in
   the "()" characters: KEYWORD = ( 'value1' 'value2' 'value3' ... )
 
   All assignments are either required, conditional or optional as
   described below.
 
   A setup file may contain blank lines. Non-printing characters including
   TAB should not be used in setup file lines containing keyword
   assignments or blank lines separating them within the data sections of a
   setup file. The program may not be able to parse correctly any of the
   setup file lines that contain non-printing characters and will signal a
   setup file parsing error on some computer platforms.
 
 
Required Assignments
 
   The following assignments must be present in a setup file:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE   = 'STATES' or 'ELEMENTS' or 'EQ_ELEMENTS'
                             or 'TL_ELEMENTS'

                               'PCK_2 file name'
                                 ...
                               'PCK_n file name' )

                             or shouldn't be appended to an existing SPK
                             file
 
 
Detailed Description of Setup File Keywords
--------------------------------------------------------
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE     type of input data. Only one of four allowed
                             values may be used as shown above.
 
         OUTPUT_SPK_TYPE     type of output SPK file. Only one of eight
                             allowed values may be used as shown above.
 
         OBJECT_ID           numeric ID code of the object.
 
                             For all input data type/output SPK type
                             combinations except 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10
                             (called 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 case elsewhere in
                             the text) this is the NAIF ID code of the
                             object (which for spacecraft or other vehicles
                             must be a negative number). If NAIF has not
                             assigned an ID code (based on DSN assignments)
                             the user may select a temporary ID, avoiding
                             the range of -0 through -512. (It might be
                             useful to contact NAIF for assignment of a
                             temporary code.) If this keyword is absent the
                             OBJECT_NAME keyword must be used.
 
                             For the 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 case this is the
                             TLE spacecraft code. Because the NAIF ID for a
                             spacecraft must be a negative number while the
                             TLE ID is a positive number, the spacecraft ID
                             that will appear in the output SPK file is
                             constructed from the TLE ID using the
                             following rule:
 
                                    NAIF_ID = -100000 - TLE_ID
 
                             Alternatively, the TLE_INPUT_OBJ_ID and
                             TLE_SPK_OBJ_ID keywords can be used to
                             explicitly specify the input TLE spacecraft
                             code and the output SPK NAIF ID. Specifying
                             the OBJECT_ID keyword and the TLE_INPUT_OBJ_ID
                             and TLE_SPK_OBJ_ID keywords at the same time
                             is not allowed.
 
         OBJECT_NAME         name of the object. This is one of the NAIF
                             supported names for the object.
 
                             For all input data type/output SPK type
                             combinations except 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 this
                             keyword is required if the OBJECT_ID keyword
                             is absent. If both keywords are present, the
                             MKSPK program uses the OBJECT_ID and ignores
                             this assignment.
 
                             For the 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 case using this
                             keyword is also supported but impractical
                             because in general SPICE does not assign names
                             to TLE objects. Instead of using this keyword,
                             the TLE_INPUT_OBJ_ID and TLE_SPK_OBJ_ID
                             keywords can be used to explicitly specify the
                             input TLE spacecraft code and the output SPK
                             NAIF ID. Specifying the OBJECT_NAME keyword
                             and the TLE_INPUT_OBJ_ID and TLE_SPK_OBJ_ID
                             keywords at the same time is not allowed.
 
         TLE_INPUT_OBJ_ID    TLE spacecraft code. This is the numeric code
                             of the object, data for which should be
                             extracted from the input TLE file. This
                             keyword must be specified together with the
                             TLE_SPK_OBJ_ID keyword. Specifying it and the
                             OBJECT_ID and/or OBJECT_NAME keywords at the
                             same time is not allowed.
 
         TLE_SPK_OBJ_ID      NAIF ID for the TLE object. This is the NAIF
                             ID to be used in the output TLE-based SPK file
                             for the TLE object of interest. This keyword
                             must be specified together with the
                             TLE_INPUT_OBJ_ID keyword. Specifying it and
                             the OBJECT_ID and/or OBJECT_NAME keywords at
                             the same time is not allowed.
 
         CENTER_ID           NAIF ID of the center. This is the NAIF
                             reserved code of the center of motion for the
                             object. If this keyword is absent, the
                             CENTER_NAME keyword must be used. For the
                             'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 case this keyword must
                             have the value 399 (NAIF ID for Earth mass
                             center.)
 
         CENTER_NAME         name of the center. This is one if the NAIF
                             supported names for the center of motion. This
                             keyword is required if the CENTER_ID keyword
                             is absent. If both keywords are present the
                             MKSPK program uses the CENTER_ID and ignores
                             this assignment. If this keyword is provided
                             for the 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 case, it must
                             have the value 'Earth'.
 
         REF_FRAME_NAME      name of the reference frame. If this is not a
                             standard frame supported by NAIF, the
                             definition for this frame must be present in a
                             frame definitions kernel file specified in the
                             FRAME_DEF_FILE keyword. For the
                             'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 case this keyword must
                             have the value 'J2000'.
 
         PRODUCER_ID         producer identifier. This is a name
                             identifying the producer of this SPK file.
                             This value will appear in the comment area of
                             the SPK.
 
         DATA_ORDER          ordered list of input parameter names as they
                             appear in the input data records. The names
                             are delimited with white space.
 
         DATA_DELIMITER      delimiter used to separate data items. This is
                             picked from the following set: 'TAB' , 'EOL' ,
                             comma (',') , semicolon (';') or white space
                             (' '). Only one of these values can be used.
                             If your data does not use one of these
                             delimiters the data must be modified before
                             being processed through MKSPK.
 
         LEAPSECONDS_FILE    leapseconds file name. This is the SPICE LSK
                             file name, including full or relative path
                             specification.
 
         INPUT_DATA_FILE     input data file name. This keyword must be
                             used if the input data file name is not
                             provided on the command line. Include path if
                             needed.
 
         OUTPUT_SPK_FILE     output data file name. This keyword must be
                             used if the output SPK file name is not
                             provided on the command line. Include path if
                             needed.
 
         PCK_FILE            SPICE Planetary Constants file name. One or
                             more files can be used. This keyword may be
                             absent in the case when you do not need PCK
                             constants or when these constants are defined
                             with other setup keywords. Include path(s) if
                             needed. For the 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 case a
                             PCK file containing Earth geophysical
                             constants must be provided using this keyword.
 
         FRAME_DEF_FILE      frame definition file name. This keyword is
                             required if the reference frame specified in
                             the REF_FRAME_NAME keyword is not one defined
                             in SPICE Toolkit Software. In this case the
                             frame must be defined in a frames definition
                             kernel file. Include path if needed.
 
         COMMENT_FILE        comment file name. This keyword is used if you
                             want to include comments provided in this file
                             in the comment area of the SPK file. Include
                             path if needed.
 
         INPUT_DATA_UNITS    angle and distance units. The values of this
                             keyword define the units used for angles and
                             distances appearing in the input data if these
                             are not RADIANS or KM. All angle and distance
                             units supported by SPICE may be used. The
                             value fields take the form of an assignment,
                             such as 'ANGLES=DEGREES' and
                             'DISTANCES=NAUTICAL_MILES'. The complete list
                             of angle and distance units that are
                             recognized by MKSPK is:
 
                                    RADIANS
                                    DEGREES        ARCMINUTES

                                    LIGHTYEARS
 
                             Note that MKSPK assumes that the time units of
                             any input data parameters or constants
                             specified in the setup file are seconds.
 
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH    length (number of characters, including white
                             space) of input data record epoch strings,
                             from the first through the last non blank
                             character. This length must be provided to the
                             program in order to enable parsing of the
                             input data records containing two epoch
                             strings and using data delimiter characters
                             which are also allowed in SPICE time strings
                             -- white space (' ') or comma (',').
 
         IGNORE_FIRST_LINE   number of lines to be ignored at the beginning
                             of the input file. If this keyword is absent,
                             the program starts data processing from the
                             first line of the input file.
 
         LINES_PER_RECORD    number of lines in each input record. This
                             keyword must be present if EPOCH_STR_LENGTH is
                             absent and the data delimiter is one also
                             allowed in SPICE time strings -- white space
                             (' ') or comma (',').
 
         TIME_WRAPPER        the specification of alphanumeric characters
                             that are used to either complete and/or
                             further define the "EPOCH" strings (and the
                             "EPOCHP" string, if this is also used)
                             provided in the input data and processed by
                             the program using the SPICE's time conversion
                             routine STR2ET . Such characters may be added
                             at the front (prefix), the end (suffix), or
                             both of the epoch (and epochp, if used) data
                             items. The location of the epoch (and epochp)
                             data relative to prefix or suffix characters
                             is specified with the
 
                                    "#"
 
                             character. As example,
 
                                    TIME_WRAPPER = '# TDT'
 
                             would add the characters ' TDT' to the end of
                             every epoch value (and to the epochp value, if
                             present).
 
                             If the "EPOCH" (and "EPOCHP") time tags are
                             provided as ET seconds past J2000 this keyword
                             must be set to the following special value:
 
                                    TIME_WRAPPER = '# ETSECONDS'
 
                             See "Using Time Wrappers" later in this
                             document for more details.
 
         START_TIME          start time. This keyword defines the first
                             valid epoch of the output SPK file. This value
                             is always required for output SPK Types 15 and
                             17. If this value is absent for other output
                             types, the MKSPK program calculates it using
                             input data.
 
                             This keyword also applies when making
                             'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 SPK files. For such cases
                             it is not allowed to specify this keyword
                             together with the TLE_START_PAD keyword. If
                             neither START_TIME nor TLE_START_PAD is
                             specified the output TLE-based SPK coverage
                             start time is automatically set to be 12 hours
                             before the time of the first input two-line
                             elements set.
 
         TLE_START_PAD       TLE-based SPK coverage start pad. This keyword
                             specifies the pad to be applied to the time of
                             the first input two-line elements set to
                             expand the coverage of the output TLE-based
                             SPK file. The value of this keyword must be a
                             string specifying positive or zero duration
                             and units, for example '6 hours', '3 days'.
                             The following units are supported and can be
                             specified in lower, upper, or mixed case:
                             ``seconds'', ``minutes'', ``hours'', and
                             ``days''. Positive durations expand the
                             coverage of the output SPK file -- the SPK
                             coverage start time will be earlier as
                             compared to the time of the first input
                             two-line elements set -- while zero durations
                             set the start of the coverage of the output
                             SPK file to be exactly the time of the first
                             input two-line elements set.
 
                             This keyword applies only when making
                             'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 SPK files and is ignored
                             in all other cases. It is not allowed to
                             specify this keyword together with the
                             START_TIME keyword. If neither START_TIME nor
                             TLE_START_PAD is specified the output
                             TLE-based SPK coverage start time is
                             automatically set to be 12 hours before the
                             time of the first input two-line elements set,
                             equivalent to TLE_START_PAD = '12 hours'.
 
         STOP_TIME           stop time. This keyword defines the last valid
                             epoch of the output SPK file. This value is
                             always required for output SPK Types 15 and
                             17. If this value is absent for other output
                             types, the MKSPK program calculates it using
                             input data.
 
                             This keyword also applies when making
                             'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 SPK files. For such cases
                             it is not allowed to specify this keyword
                             together with the TLE_STOP_PAD keyword. If
                             neither STOP_TIME nor TLE_STOP_PAD is
                             specified the output TLE-based SPK coverage
                             stop time is automatically set to be 12 hours
                             after the time of the last input two-line
                             elements set.
 
         TLE_STOP_PAD        TLE-based SPK coverage stop pad. This keyword
                             specifies the time pad to be applied to the
                             time of the last input two-line elements set
                             to expand the coverage of the output TLE-based
                             SPK file. The value of this keyword must be a
                             string specifying positive or zero duration
                             and units, for example '6 hours', '3 days'.
                             The following units are supported and can be
                             specified in the lower, upper, or mixed case:
                             ``seconds'', ``minutes'', ``hours'', and
                             ``days''. Positive durations expand the
                             coverage of the output SPK file -- the SPK
                             coverage stop time will be later as compared
                             to the time of the last input two-line
                             elements set -- while zero durations set the
                             start of the coverage of the output SPK file
                             to be exactly the time of the last input
                             two-line elements set.
 
                             This keyword applies only when making
                             'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 SPK files and is ignored
                             in all other cases. It is not allowed to
                             specify this keyword together with the
                             STOP_TIME keyword. If neither STOP_TIME not
                             TLE_STOP_PAD is specified the output TLE-based
                             SPK coverage stop time is automatically set to
                             be 12 hours after the time of the last input
                             two-line elements set, equivalent to
                             TLE_STOP_PAD = '12 hours'.
 
         PRECESSION_TYPE     J2 processing flag for output type 15. Only
                             one of four values may be specified using this
                             keyword: 'NO PRECESSION', 'APSIDE PRECESSION
                             ONLY', 'NODE PRECESSION ONLY', 'APSIDE AND
                             NODE PRECESSION'
 
         POLYNOM_DEGREE      polynomial degree of Lagrange interpolation
                             for output SPK Type 8 or 9, or polynomial
                             degree of Hermite interpolation for output SPK
                             type 12 or 13. The polynomial degree of
                             Hermite interpolation must be an odd number.
                             Also, to ensure continuity of the polynomials
                             over the time span covered by an SPK segment
                             the degree for SPK types 8 and 9 should be odd
                             while the degree for SPK types 12 and 13
                             should be equivalent to 3 mod 4 (3, 7, 11,
                             etc.)
 
         CENTER_GM           center GM. This keyword specifies the GM of
                             the central body. If it is absent, the MKSPK
                             program attempts to find this value in a PCK
                             file. You do not need this keyword when input
                             type is STATE and output type is 8, 9, 12 or
                             13 and when input type is EQ_ELEMENTS and
                             output type is 17.
 
         CENTER_POLE_RA      the right ascension of the central body's
                             north pole. This keyword is used for output
                             types 15 and 17. If it is absent, the MKSPK
                             program attempts to compute this value using
                             loaded PCK constants. The value must in units
                             specified in the keyword INPUT_DATA_UNITS and
                             with respect to the frame specified in the
                             keyword REF_FRAME_NAME.
 
         CENTER_POLE_DEC     the declination of the central body's north
                             pole. This keyword is used for output types 15
                             and 17. If it is absent, the MKSPK program
                             attempts to compute this value using loaded
                             PCK constants. The value must in units
                             specified in the keyword INPUT_DATA_UNITS and
                             with respect to the frame specified in the
                             keyword REF_FRAME_NAME.
 
         CENTER_J2           central body's J2 coefficient. This keyword is
                             needed only for output type 15. If it is
                             absent, the MKSPK program attempts to find its
                             value in a PCK file.
 
         CENTER_EQ_RADIUS    equatorial radius of central body. This
                             keyword is needed only for output type 15. If
                             it is absent, the MKSPK program attempts to
                             find its value in a PCK file.
 
         SEGMENT_ID          segment identifier. The value assigned to this
                             keyword can be up to 40 characters long. If
                             this keyword is absent, the MKSPK program will
                             use the first 40 characters on the
                             INPUT_FILE_NAME value as the segment
                             identifier.
 
         APPEND_TO_OUTPUT    optional flag specifying whether it's
                             permitted to append new segments to an
                             existing SPK file. This keyword can have one
                             of these two values: 'YES' if segments can be
                             appended and 'NO' if appending segments is not
                             permitted. If this keyword is not present, the
                             program assumes the value 'NO'. An -append
                             flag specified on the command line overrides
                             either value of this keyword.
 
 
Description of Input Data Format
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   MKSPK requires the input data file to be an ASCII text file containing
   states, conic elements or equinoctial elements, or Space Command
   two-line elements. Any two-line elements file has fixed format and is
   processed as a special case; an input file containing any other type of
   input data must comply with the rules described in this section and the
   section immediately following it.
 
   All lines in the input file, including the last line, must be terminated
   with the line terminators native to the computer platform on which the
   program is run. If the lines are terminated with a non-native
   terminator, the program will not be able to process the input file
   correctly. If the last line of the input file is not terminated with the
   proper line terminator, the program will ignore it causing the data
   written to the output SPK file be incomplete.
 
   The input file must contain a number of data records sufficient to
   generate an SPK file of a specified type (see subsection below). Each of
   the records must occupy the same number of non-blank lines and contain
   the same set of input data items, provided in the same order. Blank
   lines can appear anywhere between non-blank record lines and are not
   taken into account by the program.
 
   The data set contained in each record must correspond to a single epoch.
   Data records in an input file must be provided in strictly increasing
   time order based on the values of the data item EPOCH. Data records with
   duplicate EPOCHs are not allowed.
 
   An input file may also contain one or more initial lines that do not
   represent a valid data record (for example a table header). These lines
   can be ignored by specifying their count in the IGNORE_FIRST_LINE setup
   file keyword.
 
   The order of the data items in each input data record must be specified
   in the DATA_ORDER keyword.
 
   Input data items within each data record must be separated by one of the
   following delimiters:
 
         'TAB' or  'EOL' or  ';' or  ','  or  ' '
 
   The delimiter is not required but is permitted after the last data item
   on a line. Any spaces between the delimiter and preceding or following
   data items are ignored. In the case when white space is used as the
   delimiter, multiple spaces between data items are treated as a single
   space.
 
   If tabulation ('TAB'), end-of-line ('EOL') or semicolon (';') is used as
   the data delimiter then only two setup file keywords are required for
   MKSPK in order to parse input data -- DATA_ORDER and DATA_DELIMITER.
 
   If comma (',') or white space (' '), which are also allowed in SPICE
   time strings, is used as the data delimiter and the input data records
   contain only one time parameter (EPOCH), then the number of lines in
   each input data record must be specified using the setup file keyword
   LINES_PER_RECORD. The DATA_ORDER and DATA_DELIMITER keywords must also
   be used.
 
   If comma (',') or white space (' ') is used as the data delimiter and
   the input data records contain two times (EPOCH and EPOCHP), then both
   input times must have the same width, from the first though the last
   non-blank character, and this width must be specified in the setup file
   keyword EPOCH_STR_LENGTH. The DATA_ORDER and DATA_DELIMITER keywords
   must also be used.
 
 
Description of Input Data Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The MKSPK program gains considerable flexibility by accepting several
   forms of ephemeris information and epochs. Further flexibility is
   achieved by allowing the user to tell MKSPK how those input data are
   organized, and, by allowing the user to clearly identify the time system
   and format used for time tags (epochs).
 
   Listed below are the names of all the input data known to MKSPK--you
   would use just a subset of these in any one MKSPK session. How you use
   these parameter names to tell MKSPK what kind of input data are to be
   processed is described below. Note that one parameter name, "SKIP", is
   used to indicate that some item(s) in your input data file are to be
   ignored by MKSPK.
 
         EPOCH     epoch of the data, given in any time format allowed by
                   the SPICE's time conversion routine STR2ET (for details,
                   see section ``STR2ET'' of the Time Required Reading
                   document, time.req) or as a DP number representing ET
                   seconds past J2000. Note that the setup file keyword
                   TIME_WRAPPER, which is optionally used to modify input
                   times processed by STR2ET, must be set to the value
 
                         '# ETSECONDS'
 
                   to process times given as ET seconds past J2000. This
                   keyword is described below in the section ``Using Time
                   Wrappers.''

         EPOCHP    epoch of periapsis, given in any time format allowed by
                   the SPICE's time conversion routine STR2ET (for details,
                   see section ``STR2ET'' of the Time Required Reading
                   document, time.req) or as a DP number representing ET
                   seconds past J2000. Note that the setup file keyword
                   TIME_WRAPPER, which is optionally be used to modify
                   input periapsis times processed by STR2ET, must be set
                   to the value
 
                         '# ETSECONDS'
 
                   to process times given as ET seconds past J2000. This
                   keyword is described below in the section ``Using Time
                   Wrappers.''
 
         TAU       time interval between EPOCH and periapsis (EPOCH-EPOCHP)
                   in seconds
 
         EQ_A      1-st equinoctial element. This is the semi-major axis of
                   the orbit
 
         EQ_H      2-nd equinoctial element. This is the value of
                   (E*SIN(PER+NOD)) at the specified epoch.
 
         EQ_K      3-rd equinoctial element. This is the value of
                   (E*COS(PER+NOD)) at the specified epoch
 
         EQ_ML     4-th equinoctial element. This is the mean longitude
                   (MEAN+PER+NOD) at the specified epoch
 
         EQ_P      5-th equinoctial element. This is the value of
                   (TAN(INC/2)*SIN(NOD)) at the specified epoch
 
         EQ_Q      6-th equinoctial element. This is the value of

         DPER/DT   7-th equinoctial element. This is the rate of the
                   longitude of periapsis (dPER/dt) at the specified epoch
 
         DMPN/DT   8-th equinoctial element. This is the derivative of the
                   mean longitude (dM/dt + dPER/dt + dNOD/dt) at the
                   specified epoch.
 
         DNOD/DT   9-th equinoctial element. This is the rate of the
                   longitude of the ascending node (dNOD/dt) at the
                   specified epoch
 
         SKIP      input data record parameter to be ignored. This
                   parameter is used to identify the location in the input
                   data records of any data items, or parts of a data item
                   if a complete data item includes the delimiter within
                   its value, that are not needed by MKSPK and therefore
                   should be ignored. This string may be used as many times
                   as needed. Note that sometimes more than one SKIP may be
                   needed to ignore an additional time tag in an input
                   record if the delimiter is comma or white space.
 
 
Description of Input Data Types and Content
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Four types of input data can be processed by the program:
 
         STATES, ELEMENTS, EQ_ELEMENTS, TL_ELEMENTS
 
   If input type is STATES, you can create an SPK of output types: 5, 8, 9,
   12, 13, 15 and 17.
 
   If input type is ELEMENTS, you can create an SPK of output types: 5, 8,
   9, 12, 13, 15 and 17.
 
   If input type is EQ_ELEMENTS, you can create only an SPK of output type
   17.
 
   If input type is TL_ELEMENTS, you can create only an SPK of output type
   10.
 
 
Input Type STATES
 
   An input file of the STATES type must contain records consisting of
   EPOCH and a full set of state vector parameters X, Y, Z, VX, VY, Vz.
 
   If you use the STATES input type to produce an SPK of Type 17, you must
   also include three equinoctial parameters:
 
         DPER/DT, DMPN/DT, DNOD/DT
 
   in addition to the state vector.
 
 
Input Type ELEMENTS
 
   An input file of the ELEMENTS type must contain records consisting of
   EPOCH, E, INC, PER, NOD and one of A, RPI, T, P, as well as one of MEAN,
   EXAN, TRAN, EPOCHP, TAU.
 
   If you use the ELEMENTS input type to produce an SPK of Type 17, you
   must also include three equinoctial parameters:
 
         DPER/DT, DMPN/DT, DNOD/DT
 
   in addition to the state vector.
 
 
Input Type EQ_ELEMENTS
 
   An input file of the EQ_ELEMENTS type must contain EPOCH and nine
   equinoctial elements EQ_A, EQ_H, EQ_K, EQ_ML, EQ_P, EQ_Q, DPER/DT,
   DMPN/DT, DNOD/DT.
 
 
Input Type TL_ELEMENTS
 
   An input file of the TL_ELEMENTS type has a pre-defined format and is
   processed by the program in a special way. Therefore, the program does
   not need specification of the record data order and ignores all setup
   file keywords describing input data format.
 
 
Relation Between Number of Input Records and Output Types
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   An SPK of Type 5 requires one or more input records of time ordered
   STATES or ELEMENTS. If the input file contains only one record, the
   program can formally create an SPK of Type 5 but this file will not be
   useful for real applications.
 
   An SPK of Types 8, 9 requires input records of time ordered STATES or
   ELEMENTS. The degree of Lagrange polynomial specified by the keyword
   POLYNOM_DEGREE must be less than the number of the data records.
 
   An SPK of Type 10 requires one or more input records of time ordered
   TL_ELEMENTS for the spacecraft with the TLE ID specified in the
   OBJECT_ID setup file keyword.
 
   An SPK of Types 12, 13 requires input records of time ordered STATES or
   ELEMENTS. The degree of Hermite polynomial specified by the keyword
   POLYNOM_DEGREE must be an odd number and less than the number of the
   data records times 2.
 
   An SPK of Type 15 requires only one input record of STATES or ELEMENTS.
   If the input file contains more than one record, only the first is used
   by the program.
 
   An SPK of Type 17 requires only one input record of EQ_ELEMENTS or one
   input record of STATES or ELEMENTS with DPER/DT, DMNP/DT, DNOD/DT added.
   If the input file contains more than one record, only the first is used
   by the program.
 
 
Examples of Input Data and Setup Files
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Data Order and Data Delimiters
 
   To use an input data file you must describe the order of data items in
   its data records and the delimiter used to separate these data items.
   You do this using appropriate keyword=value assignments in the setup
   file:
 
         DATA_ORDER     = '<param1> <param2> ... <paramN>'
         DATA_DELIMITER = '<selection>'
 
   In some situations it is necessary to use the keyword EPOCH_STR_LENGTH
   to define input epoch string length, or the keyword LINES_PER_RECORD to
   define the number of lines used for each input record. One of these
   assignments may be needed to allow MKSPK to determine which characters
   are part of the epoch parameter as opposed to being one of the state or
   elements parameters.
 
 
Example 1
 
   The input type is STATES. We first consider the case when the delimiter
   separating data items is one of those also allowed as a delimiter in
   SPICE time strings.
 
   Case 1. ------
 
   It this example the data delimiter is the comma.
 
   You have a time ordered set of states with each record consisting of one
   line.
 
         epoch1, x1, y1, z1, vx1, vy1, vz1 [,]    (record 1)
         epoch2, x2, y2, z2, vx2, vy2, vz2 [,]    (record 2)
         epoch3, x3, y3, z3, vx3, vy3, vz3 [,]    (record 3)
         epoch4, x4, y4, z4, vx4, vy4, vz4 [,]    (record 4)
         .....................................    ..........
         .....................................    ..........
 
   Note that the data delimiter at the end of each line ( record ) is
   optional (as indicated by the square brackets) and may be omitted.
 
   Let the format of each epoch string be:
 
         1998 DEC 12 10:23:20
 
   You can define this input data using the following specifications in the
   setup file:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch x y z vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH      = 20
 
   Alternatively we can use this set of specifications:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch x y z vx vy vz '
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         LINES_PER_RECORD      = 1
 
   This alternative method is possible because MKSPK is told that there are
   seven data items per line, of which the last six are the state.
   Therefore all other character strings are part of the epoch.
 
   Case 2. ------
 
   The epoch can occur in any position on the input line. For example, the
   input line could contain:
 
         x, y, z, epoch, vx, vy, vz [,]
 
   Relative to case 1 you need to change only the order of parameters in
   DATA_ORDER:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'x y z epoch vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH      = 20
 
   or
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'x y z epoch vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         LINES_PER_RECORD      = 1
 
   Case 3. ------
 
   The input data use a blank (white space) as the delimiter. For example,
   the input line could contain:
 
         x y z epoch vx vy vz
 
   You need to change only the value of DATA_DELIMITER:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'x y z epoch vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ' '
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH      = 20
 
   or
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'x y z epoch vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ' '
         LINES_PER_RECORD      = 1
 
   If the delimiter used to separate input data items is one that is not
   allowed as a delimiter in SPICE time strings (white space or comma),
   then the specifications needed in the setup file are fewer -- neither
   EPOCH_STR_LENGTH nor LINE_PER_RECORD is needed.
 
   Case 4. ------
 
   The input data use one of 'TAB', 'EOL' or ';' as delimiter. For example,
   if an input line contains:
 
         x; y; z; epoch; vx; vy; vz [;]
 
   You should change the value of DATA_DELIMITER and omit the keyword
   EPOCH_STR_LENGTH or LINES_PER_RECORD:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'x y z  epoch vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ';'
 
 
Example 2
 
   This is a more general example of input data.
 
   The input type is STATES and the delimiter is ',' which is also allowed
   in SPICE time strings.
 
   You have a time ordered set of states with epochs, and each input record
   consists of a few lines. There are some unused parameters ('not_used')
   between input data values and there are blank lines between significant
   lines. Each input record consists of 2 significant lines with none to
   several intervening blank lines:
 
         epoch1, not_used, not_used  [,]
         blank line
         x1, y1, z1, vx1, vy1, vz1   [,]        (record 1)
         epoch2, not_used, not_used  [,]
         x2, y2, z2, vx2, vy2, vz2   [,]        (record 2)
         epoch3,  not_used, not_used [,]

   Let the format of each epoch string look like this:
 
         1998 DEC 12 10:23:20.617
 
   You can define this input data using the following specification in the
   setup file:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch skip skip x y z vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH      = 24
 
   or
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'STATES'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch skip skip x y z vx vy vz'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         LINES_PER_RECORD      = 2
 
   Note that the LINES_PER_RECORD assignment specifies the number of
   ``significant'' data lines per record -- it does not need to account for
   any number of intervening blank lines.
 
   All modifications like the cases of Example 1 are possible.
 
 
Example 3
 
   Case 1: -------
 
   The input type is ELEMENTS. We consider the case when the data delimiter
   is one of those also allowed in SPICE time strings -- white space (' ')
   or comma (',').
 
   For example assume the delimiter is the comma character.
 
   You have a time ordered set of conic elements with epochs and each input
   record consists of a few lines. There are some unused parameters
   ('not_used') between input data values and occasionally some blank lines
   between significant lines. Each input record consists of 2 significant
   lines:
 
         epoch1, not_used, not_used     [,]
         blank line
         e1,a1,inc1, per1, nod1, mean1  [,]        (record 1)
         epoch2, not_used, not_used     [,]
         e2,a2,inc2, per2, nod2, mean2  [,]        (record 2)
         epoch3,  not_used, not_used    [,]
         e3,a3,inc3, per3, nod3, mean   [,]        (record 3)
         epoch4,  not_used, not_used    [,]
         blank line
         blank line
         e4,a4,inc4, per4, nod4, mean4  [,]        (record 4)
         ..............................            ..........
         ..............................            ..........
 
   The delimiter at the end of each line (record) is optional (as indicated
   by the square brackets) and may be omitted.
 
   Let the format of each epoch string look like this:
 
         1998 DEC 12 10:23:20.3
 
   You can define this input data using the following specification in the
   setup file:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'ELEMENTS'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch skip skip e a inc per nod mean'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH      = 22
 
   or
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'ELEMENTS'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch skip skip e a inc per nod mean'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         LINES_PER_RECORD      = 2
 
   You could use, by the same rules, other elements included in the list of
   parameters for input type ELEMENTS, except the case when the existing
   epoch of periapsis is also included in the input data.
 
   Case 2: -------
 
   In this example you need epoch of periapsis as an additional input data
   item and the data delimiter is one of those also allowed in SPICE time
   strings -- white space (' ') or comma (','):
 
         epoch1, not_used, not_used        [,]
         blank line
         e1,a1,inc1, per1, nod1, epochp1   [,]        (record 1)
         epoch2, not_used, not_used        [,]
         e2,a2,inc2, per2, nod2, epochp2   [,]        (record 2)
         epoch3,  not_used, not_used       [,]
         e1,a1,inc1, per1, nod1, epochp3   [,]        (record 3)
         epoch4,  not_used, not_used       [,]
         blank line
         blank line
         e1,a1,inc1, per1, nod1, epochp4   [,]        (record 4)
         ..............................               ..........
         ..............................               ..........
 
   The value of epochp must use the same format as for the epoch string:
 
         1998 DEC 12 09:12:34.9
 
   and the length of the time string (must be the same for epoch and
   epochp) must be defined using the keyword EPOCH_STR_LENGTH:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'ELEMENTS'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch skip skip e a per nod epochp'
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH      = 22
 
   All other modifications like the cases of Example 1 are possible.
 
 
Example 4
 
   Input type is EQ_ELEMENTS. We consider the case when the delimiter is
   one of those also allowed in SPICE time strings -- white space (' ') or
   comma (',').
 
   For example assume the delimiter is the comma character.
 
   Each data record consists of two lines. There are some not used
   parameters ('not_used') between some of the input data values of nine
   equinoctial elements.
 
         epoch1, eq(1), eq(2), eq(3), eq(4), eq(5), eq(6) [,]
         not_used, not_used, eq(7), eq(8), eq(9), no_used [,]
 
   The delimiter at the end of each line (record) is optional (as indicated
   by the square brackets) and may be omitted.
 
   Let the format of each epoch string look like this:
 
         1998 DEC 12 10:23
 
   You can define this input data using the following specification in the
   setup file:
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'EQ_ELEMENTS'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch eq_a eq_h eq_k eq_ml
            eq_p eq_q skip skip dper/dt dmnp/dt dnod/dt skip'  (*)
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         EPOCH_STR_LENGTH      = 17
 
   or
 
         INPUT_DATA_TYPE       = 'EQ_ELEMENTS'
         DATA_ORDER            = 'epoch eq_a eq_h eq_k eq_ml
            eq_p eq_q skip skip dper/dt dmnp/dt dnod/dt skip' (*)
         DATA_DELIMITER        = ','
         LINES_PER_RECORD      = 2
 
   (*) In a real setup file the assignment for the DATA_ORDER keywords must
   be on a single line. It was split to be on two lines only to fit onto
   the page in this document.
 
 
Using Time Wrappers
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   The TIME_WRAPPER keyword allows you to modify occurrences of time
   strings (either "epoch" or "epochp") in an input data file, either to
   add a time system identifier known to SPICE or some missing but fixed
   additional characters. The modifier alphanumeric characters are prefixed
   and/or suffixed around the given time string; enter the additional
   alphanumeric characters needed as the value for this keyword while using
   the
 
      "#"
 
   character to indicate where the given time string data are to be placed
   relative to the characters being added.
 
   As an example of providing a time string identifier, suppose the input
   data has ET Julian Date epoch values that look like this:
 
         2554617.231
 
   The SPICE's time conversion routine STR2ET will not be able to process
   these tags unless a modifier known to the SPICE system is added. You
   must indicate to STR2ET that these values are Julian Dates in ET (now
   called Barycentric Dynamical Time, abbreviated as TDB) using the
   following assignment:
 
         TIME_WRAPPER = '# JD TDB'
 
   As another example suppose the time strings are given in calendar format
   Pacific Standard Time and look like this:
 
         1999 MAR 10 14:31:22.376
 
   You must then use the TIME_WRAPPER assignment as follows:
 
         TIME_WRAPPER = '# PST'
 
   to add ``PST'' to each time string so that SPICE time parsing software
   inside MKSPK will properly interpret these time tags.
 
   You can also use this assignment to add missing information. Suppose
   your data look like this:
 
         MAR 10 14:31:22.376
 
   You should use the following TIME_WRAPPER assignment:
 
         TIME_WRAPPER = '1999 # UTC'
 
   This will prefix your data with '1999 ' and suffix your data with ' UTC'
   so the input to the time parsing software inside MKSPK will look like:
 
         1999 MAR 03 10:14:22.376 UTC
 
   A special value must be assigned to the TIME_WRAPPER keyword when input
   times are given as DP numbers representing ET seconds past J2000. Such
   time tags are not processed by STR2ET; instead, they are buffered
   directly as DP numbers. To process this kind of input times the
   TIME_WRAPPER keyword must be set as follows:
 
         TIME_WRAPPER = '# ETSECONDS'
 
 
Complete Examples
--------------------------------------------------------
 
   Examples in this section illustrate which ``keywords=value'' assignments
   must be specified in a MKSPK setup file for particular combinations of
   the input data type and format and output SPK type. Although most of the
   examples create an SPK file containing trajectory of the Jovian
   satellite AMALTHEA with respect to Jupiter, which is a not very likely
   application for this program, the guidelines for creating setup files
   demonstrated by these examples apply to the situation when an SPK file
   for a spacecraft needs to be made.
 
   If you cut and paste one of these examples to help construct your own
   setup file be sure to change all values that need to be updated for your
   particular situation.
 
 
Input Data Type STATES / Output SPK Type 05
 
   The Type 05 SPK represents a continuous ephemeris using a discrete set
   of unevenly spaced states and a two body propagation method.
 
   The PCK file 'gravity.tpc' containing GM of the central body (Jupiter)
   is specified using the PCK_FILE keyword. Alternatively, Jupiter's GM can
   be specified using the CENTER_GM keyword. The GM value will be stored in
   the output SPK file together with the states. The IGNORE_FIRST_LINE
   keyword is used to skip the header (three lines) of the input file and
   the LINES_PER_RECORD keyword is used to specify that each record of the
   input file occupies two lines, which the program must know because the
   input data delimiter ' ' is one that can be used in a SPICE time string.

Input Data Type STATES / Output SPK Type 08
 
   The Type 08 SPK represents a continuous ephemeris using a discrete set

   The POLYNOM_DEGREE keyword is used to specify the polynomial degree that
   will be used to interpolate over discreet states stored in the output

   To ensure the continuity of the interpolating polynomials over the time
   span covered by an SPK Type 08 segment the degree of the polynomial
   should be odd.

Input Data Type STATES / Output SPK Type 15
 
   The Type 15 SPK represents a continuous ephemeris using a compact
   analytic model. The object is modeled as orbiting a central body under
   the influence of a central mass plus first order secular effects of the
   J2 term in harmonic expansion of the central body gravitational
   potential.
 
   The PCK file 'gravity.tpc' containing GM and J2 of the central body
   (Jupiter) is specified using the PCK_FILE keyword. Alternatively,
   Jupiter's GM and J2 can be specified using the CENTER_GM and CENTER_J2
   keywords. The CENTER_POLE_RA and CENTER_POLE_DEC keywords contain
   Jupiter's pole RA and DEC with respect to the reference frame specified
   in the REF_FRAME_NAME keyword -- in this case B1950. If these keywords
   wouldn't be present in the setup file the program would compute these
   values from data present in the PCK file 'pck00005.tpc' provided using
   the keyword PCK_FILE. The START_TIME and STOP_TIME keywords specifying
   the file coverage interval, and the PRECESSION_TYPE keyword specifying
   the type of precession due to J2 are required for the output SPK Type
   15. Also The IGNORE_FIRST_LINE keyword is used to skip the header (three
   lines) of the input file and the LINES_PER_RECORD keyword is used to
   specify that each record of the input file occupies two lines, which the
   program must know because the input data delimiter ' ' is one that can
   be used in a SPICE time string.

Input Data Type STATES / Output SPK Type 17
 
   The SPK data Type 17 represents a continuous ephemeris using a compact
   analytic model. The object is following an elliptic orbit with
   precessing line of nodes and argument of periapse relative to the
   equatorial frame of some central body. The orbit is modeled via
   equinoctial elements.
 
   The PCK file 'gravity.tpc' containing GM of the central body (Jupiter)
   is specified using the PCK_FILE keyword. Alternatively, Jupiter's GM can
   be specified using the CENTER_GM keyword. The GM value is required to
   convert states from the input file to a set of equinoctial elements
   stored in the output SPK file. The CENTER_POLE_RA and CENTER_POLE_DEC
   keywords contain Jupiter's pole RA and DEC with respect to the reference
   frame specified in the REF_FRAME_NAME keyword -- in this case B1950. If
   these keywords wouldn't be present in the setup file the program would
   compute these values from data present in the PCK file 'pck00005.tpc'
   provided using the PCK_FILE keyword. The START_TIME and STOP_TIME

Input Data Type ELEMENTS / Output SPK Type 15
 
   The PCK file 'gravity.tpc' containing GM and J2 of the central body
   (Jupiter) is specified using the PCK_FILE keyword. Alternatively,
   Jupiter's GM and J2 can be specified using the CENTER_GM and CENTER_J2
   keywords. The CENTER_POLE_RA and CENTER_POLE_DEC keywords contain
   Jupiter's pole RA and DEC with respect to the reference frame specified
   in the REF_FRAME_NAME keyword -- in this case B1950. If these keywords
   wouldn't be present in the setup file, the program would compute these
   value from data present in the PCK file 'pck00005.tpc' provided using
   the keyword PCK_FILE. The START_TIME and STOP_TIME keywords specifying
   the file coverage interval and the PRECESSION_TYPE keyword specifying
   the type of precession due to J2 are required for the output SPK Type
   15. The IGNORE_FIRST_LINE keyword is used to skip the header (three
   lines) of the input file and the LINES_PER_RECORD keyword is used to
   specify that each record of the input file occupies two lines, which the
   program must know because the input data delimiter ' ' is one that can
   be used in a SPICE time string.

   NAIF ID for HST; this ID is used in the output SPK file. The CENTER_ID
   and REF_FRAME_NAME contain required values of 399 and 'J2000'
   correspondingly. The PCK_FILE keyword contains the name of an Earth
   geophysical constants PCK file; a copy of such file is usually provided
   with the SPICE toolkit under the ``/data'' directory. The TLE_START_PAD
   and TLE_STOP_PAD keywords specify that the output SPK coverage should
   start two days before the time of the first input TLE set and should
   extend two days past the time of the last TLE set. Note that no keywords
   describing input data format are present in the setup file. These
   keywords are not needed for 'TL_ELEMENTS'/SPK 10 program runs because
   two-line elements files have fixed format and are processed by the
   program as a special case.

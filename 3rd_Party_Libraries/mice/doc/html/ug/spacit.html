<H2> Abstract
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   SPACIT is an interactive program that converts kernels in transfer
   format to binary format, converts binary kernels to transfer format, and
   summarizes the contents of binary kernels.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Introduction"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The SPACIT utility is an interactive menu driven program which provides
   a collection of services useful for manipulating and examining SPICE
   binary kernel files. The program may be used to convert SPICE binary
   kernel files into equivalent ASCII files, called SPICE transfer files,
   and to convert the SPICE transfer files back to binary. SPACIT may also
   be used to summarize the information contained in SPICE binary kernel
   files and to read the comments contained in the comment area of a SPICE
   binary kernel file.
<P>
 
   The SPACIT program currently supports the CK, EK, PCK, and SPK SPICE
   binary kernel file formats.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> CK files contain orientation information, commonly called ``pointing,'' for
various spacecraft structures or instruments.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> EK files contain time tagged event information for a spacecraft during a
mission.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> PCK files contain highly accurate body orientation and shape information
for performing rotations, etc. Binary PCK files are currently only
available for the Moon with limited time coverage.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> SPK files contain ephemeris information for solar system objects: planets,
satellites, comets, asteroids, and spacecraft.
<BR><BR></UL>
   In addition to SPICE binary kernel files, SPACIT requires additional
   SPICE files when used to summarize a binary kernel file.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Leapseconds kernel files contain a tabulation of leapseconds which have
occurred. The leapseconds information is required to perform time
conversions between ephemeris time (ET, TDB), which is used for
representing times within the SPICE system, and Universal Time Coordinated
(UTC), which is used for input and output purposes by the SPACIT program.
This file is required for summarizing CK, EK, PCK and SPK binary kernel
files.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> SCLK kernel files contain information which describes a spacecraft clock
for a particular mission, e.g.: clock rates, partition information, etc..
The SCLK information is required to perform time conversions between a
standard time system such as ET (TDB) or UTC and the mission dependent
encoded spacecraft clock times. See the SCLK Required Reading document,
<a href="../req/sclk.html">sclk.req</a>, listed in the references section for details. This file is
required for summarizing binary CK files.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The SPACIT program is one component of the portable NAIF Toolkit.
<P>
 
   Note that NAIF uses the terminology ``ephemeris time'' (ET) to mean
   ``barycentric dynamical time'' (TDB).

<H2> Changes
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   This version of the SPACIT utilty program has been modified in several
   significant ways:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> Support for automatic identification of SPICE binary file types has been
enhanced.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> The user interface to the program has been modified slightly to enhance the
presentation.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> The summary display formats for the SPK and CK files have been modified.
The new summary format is, hopefully, more readable than the old summary
format. Names for bodies, reference frames, and data type descriptions have
also been added to the summaries.

<H2> File Naming and Usage Conventions
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Filenames are required for options in the SPACIT program. In order to
   maintain portability a filename must, in addition to any conditions
   imposed by a particular computer or operating system, satisfy the
   following conditions.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> A filename must be nonblank.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> A filename may not contain embedded spaces.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> A filename may not contain nonprinting or ``control'' characters, e.g.,
tabs, line feeds, carriage returns, nulls, form feeds, etc.. The
nonprinting and control characters are those having ASCII decimal values
0-31 and 127.
<BR><BR></UL>
   Be aware that on many computer systems filenames are case sensitive. On
   such a system, the filenames `program.for' and `PROGRAM.FOR' are
   different. On a computer system that does not support case sensitive
   filenames these filenames would both refer to the same file.
<P>
 
   Also be aware that each computer system will have a limit on the length
   of a filename. Care must be taken when moving files from a computer
   system which supports longer filenames to a computer system which
   supports shorter filenames, in particular if the initial portion of the
   filenames are identical.
<P>
 
   When creating a new file the SPACIT program will not allow an existing
   filename to be used. Before the program creates a file it determines
   whether a file with the entered filename already exists. If so, a brief
   message reporting this is displayed and an opportunity to reenter the
   filename will be provided. This is done in order to prevent accidental
   modification of existing files.
<P>
 
   If at any time an improper filename is entered: a file which did not
   exist when it should have, a file which existed when it should not have,
   or a filename containing improper characters, an appropriate error
   message will be displayed. A chance to reenter the filename will be
   provided via a ``Try again? (Yes/No)'' prompt. A response of ``Yes'' and
   the prompt for the filename will be redisplayed. A response of ``No''
   will return the program to the main menu.
<P>

<A NAME="Using SPACIT"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H1> Using SPACIT
</H1><HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE><P><BR><BR><BR>
   The SPACIT utility program is an interactive menu driven program which
   provides a collection of services useful for manipulating and examining
   SPICE binary kernel files. The SPACIT utility program provides four
   services for use with SPICE binary kernel files.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Convert a SPICE transfer file into an equivalent binary kernel file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Convert a binary kernel file to an equivalent SPICE transfer file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Summarize the data contained in a binary kernel file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Read the comment area of a binary kernel file.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The desired service may be selected by choosing the appropriate option
   from the main menu of the SPACIT program. An option is selected by
   entering the letter or number appearing in parentheses to the left of
   the option description. The selection of an option is not case
   sensitive.
<P>
 
   In addition to the four basic services for each type of binary kernel
   file, the SPACIT utility program has the ability to maintain a log of
   its actions in a text file. This feature was provided so that the
   information obtained through the SPACIT program could be saved and read
   or printed at a later time. By default, output from the SPACIT program
   is displayed only on the terminal screen.
<P>
 
   The SPICE transfer files produced by the SPACIT utility are the
   recommended means for porting data contained in SPICE binary kernel
   files among various computer systems. The SPICE transfer files are
   useful only for porting data among different computer systems or for
   system independent archival storage. The SPICE transfer file cannot be
   used directly as a means of providing data to a program which uses the
   SPICE system. This capability is provided through the SPICE binary
   kernel files and their associated readers.
<P>
 
   When summarizing a SPICE binary kernel file additional files are
   required: a SPICE leapseconds file and a SPICE SCLK file when
   summarizing a CK file. See the descriptions of these files in the
   introduction. A name for each of these files is supplied only once
   during a SPACIT session and they are valid throughout the session. These
   files are loaded the first time that a summary option requiring one of
   the files is selected. If an SCLK file has been loaded and a different
   SCLK file is desired, the current SPACIT session must be abandoned and a
   new SPACIT session begun by restarting the program.

   This option may be selected at any time during a SPACIT session and it
   is active throughout the remainder of that session. The first time that
   this option is selected a prompt requesting a name for the log file will
   be displayed. A filename for the SPACIT log file should be entered at
   this time. The name entered must be the name of a new file. If not,
   SPACIT will report that the file already exists, and provide an
   opportunity to reenter the filename.
<P>
 
   There is no default filename for the SPACIT log file, and only one log
   file may be open during a SPACIT session. If a log file has already been
   successfully opened and this option is selected, a brief message stating
   that a SPACIT log file is currently open will be displayed, and the
   program will return to the main menu. If an error occurs while
   attempting to open the SPACIT log file, it will be reported and the
   program will return to the main menu.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>

   should be entered. The name entered for the binary file to be created
   must be that of a new file. Otherwise SPACIT will report that the file
   already exists and provide an opportunity to reenter the filename.

   Convert a SPICE binary kernel file into an equivalent portable SPICE
   transfer file.
<P>
 
   This option requires that two filenames be supplied:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The name of an existing SPICE binary kernel file to be converted into an
equivalent SPICE transfer file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The name of the SPICE transfer file to be created.
<BR><BR></UL>
   When option ``B'' is selected, prompts requesting each of the required
   file names will be displayed. For each prompt the appropriate filename
   should be entered. The name entered for the SPICE transfer file to be
   created must be that of a new file. Otherwise SPACIT will report that
   the file already exists and provide an opportunity to reenter the
   filename.
<P>
 
   The SPICE transfer file produced will be approximately three times the
   size of the original binary kernel file.
<P>
 
   The SPICE transfer files produced by SPACIT may be used as a vehicle for
   porting the data that was contained in the original binary kernel files
   to different computer systems. Once the SPICE transfer files have been
   ported to a new computer, the SPACIT program may be used to convert them
   into their binary equivalents on that computer. This capability is
   necessary if data files created or stored on one computer system are to
   be used on computer systems having different representations for similar
   data objects, like double precision numbers.

<H3> SPACIT Option: S -- Summarize binary file.
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Summarize the information contained in a SPICE binary kernel file.
<P>
 
   This option requires the name of the SPICE binary kernel file that is to
   be summarized. In addition, names for a SPICE leapseconds kernel file or
   a SPICE SCLK kernel file may be necessary, depending on the type of the
   kernel file being summarized and the files that are currently loaded.
<P>
 
   When option ``S'' is selected, prompts requesting each of the required
   filenames will be displayed. For each prompt the appropriate filename
   should be entered. The prompt for the SPICE leapseconds kernel file will
   only be displayed if SPACIT has not already loaded a leapseconds file.
   Similarly, the prompt for the SPICE SCLK kernel file will only be
   displayed if this file has not already been loaded.
<P>
 
   Names for bodies, reference frames, and data types are included in the
   summaries when they are available. ID codes for body names, reference
   frames, and data types appear enclosed in parentheses to the right of
   the name. If a name is not available for a particular body ID code a
   ``Name Not Found'' indicator will be placed where the name would
   normally appear in the summary. Similarly, if the ID code for an
   inertial reference frame or SPICE data type is not recognized, an
   indication of this will be placed where their names would normally

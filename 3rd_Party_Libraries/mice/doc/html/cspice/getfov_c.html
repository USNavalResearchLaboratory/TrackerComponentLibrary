   instid     is the NAIF ID of an instrument. 
 
   room       is the maximum number of 3D vectors that can be returned 
              in `bounds'. 

   shapelen   is the available space in the `shape' string, counting
              room for the terminating null.  Up to shapelen-1 &quot;data&quot;
              characters will be assigned to the output string `shape'.
 
   framelen   is the available space in the `frame' string, counting
              room for the terminating null.  Up to framelen-1 &quot;data&quot;
              characters will be assigned to the output string `frame'.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
 
   shape      is a character string that describes the &quot;shape&quot; of 
              the field of view.  Possible values returned are: 
 
                 &quot;POLYGON&quot;
                 &quot;RECTANGLE&quot;
                 &quot;CIRCLE&quot;
                 &quot;ELLIPSE&quot; 
 
              If the value of `shape' is &quot;POLYGON&quot; the field of view of
              the instrument is a pyramidal polyhedron. The vertex of
              the pyramid is at the instrument focal point. The rays
              along the edges of the pyramid are parallel to the
              vectors returned in `bounds'.
 
              If the value of `shape' is &quot;RECTANGLE&quot; the field of view
              of the instrument is a rectangular pyramid. The vertex of
              the pyramid is at the instrument focal point.  The rays
              along the edges of the pyramid are parallel to the
              vectors returned in `bounds'.  Moreover, in this case,
              the boresight points along the axis of symmetry of the
              rectangular pyramid.
 
              If the value of `shape' is &quot;CIRCLE&quot; the field of view of
              the instrument is a circular cone about the boresight
              vector.  The vertex of the cone is at the instrument
              focal point.  A single vector will be returned in
              `bounds'.  This vector will be parallel to a ray that
              lies in the cone that makes up the boundary of the field
              of view.
 
              If the value of `shape' is &quot;ELLIPSE&quot; the field of view of
              the instrument is an elliptical cone with the boresight
              vector as the axis of the cone.  The vertex of the cone
              is at the instrument focal point. Two vectors are
              returned in `bounds'. One of the vectors points to the
              end of the semi-major axis of a perpendicular cross
              section of the elliptic cone.  The other vector points to
              the end of the semi-minor axis of a perpendicular cross
              section of the cone.
 
  
   frame      is the name of the reference frame in which the field of 
              view boundary vectors are defined. 
 
   bsight     is a vector that points in the direction of the 
              center of the field of view.  The length of bsight 
              is not specified other than being non-zero. 
 
   n          is the number of boundary vectors returned. 
 
   bounds     is an array of vectors that point to the &quot;corners&quot; 
              of the instrument field of view.  (See the discussion 
              accompanying `shape' for an expansion of the term 
              &quot;corner of the field of view.&quot;)  Note that the vectors 
              returned in `bounds' are not necessarily unit vectors.

<h4><a name="Parameters">Parameters</a></h4>
<PRE>
 
   MINCOS     This parameter is the lower limit on the value of the
              cosine of the cross or reference angles in the ANGLES
              specification cases (see Particulars for further
              discussion). The parameter and its current value,
              1.0x10^(-15), are employed in the C code derived from the
              Fortran version of GETFOV that this wrapper invokes.
 </PRE>
<h4><a name="Exceptions">Exceptions</a></h4>
<PRE>
   1) The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if either the `shape' or
      `frame' string pointers are null.

   2) The user must pass values indicating the length of the `shape' 
      and `frame' strings.  If these values are not at least 2, the
      error SPICE(STRINGTOOSHORT) is signaled.
 
   3) The error SPICE(FRAMEMISSING) is signaled if the reference frame
      associated with the instrument can not be found in the kernel
      pool.
 
   4) The error SPICE(SHAPEMISSING) is signaled if the shape of the
      instrument field of view can not be found in the kernel pool.
 
   5) The error SPICE(SHAPENOTSUPPORTED) is signaled if the shape
      specified by the instrument kernel is not one of the four
      values: 'CIRCLE', 'POLYGON', 'ELLIPSE', 'RECTANGLE'.  If the
      ANGLES specification is used it must be: 'CIRCLE', 'ELLIPSE', or 
     'RECTANGLE'.
 
   6) The error SPICE(BORESIGHTMISSING) is signaled if the direction
      of the boresight cannot be located in the kernel pool.
 
   7) The error SPICE(BADBORESIGHTSPEC) is signaled if the number of
      components for the boresight vector in the kernel pool is not 3.
 
   8) The error SPICE(BOUNDARYMISSING) is signaled if the boundary
      vectors for the edge of the field of view cannot be found in the
      kernel pool.
 
   9) The error SPICE(BOUNDARYTOOBIG) is signaled if there is
      insufficient room (as specified by the variable `room') to return
      all of the vectors associated with the boundary of the field of
      view.
 
  10) The error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is signaled if the number of
      components of vectors making up the field of view is not a
      multiple of 3.
 
  11) The error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is signaled if the number of
      components of vectors making up the field of view is not
      compatible with the shape specified for the field of view.

  12) The error SPICE(REFVECTORMISSING) is signaled if the 
      reference vector for the ANGLES spec can not be found
      in the kernel pool.

  13) The error SPICE(BADREFVECTORSPEC) is signaled if the
      reference vector stored in the kernel pool to support
      the ANGLES spec contains an incorrect number of components,
      contains 3 character components, or is parallel to the
      boresight.
 
  14) The error SPICE(REFANGLEMISSING) is signaled if the reference
      angle that supports the ANGLES spec is absent from the kernel
      pool.
 
  15) The error SPICE(UNITSMISSING) is signaled if the
      keyword that stores the angular units for the angles
      used in the ANGLES spec is absent from the kernel pool.
  
  16) The error SPICE(CROSSANGLEMISSING) is signaled if the
      keyword that stores the cross angle for the ANGLES spec
      is needed and is absent from the kernel pool.
 
  17) The error SPICE(BADBOUNDARY) is signaled if the angles
      for the RECTANGLE/ANGLES spec case have cosines that
      are less than those stored in the parameter MINCOS.
 
  18) The error SPICE(UNSUPPORTEDSPEC) is signaled if the
      class specification contains something other than 'ANGLES'
      or 'CORNERS'.
 
  19) In the event that the CLASS_SPEC keyword is absent from the
      kernel pool for the instrument whose FOV is sought, this
      module assumes the default CORNERS specification is to be
      utilized.

   This routine relies upon having successfully loaded an instrument
   kernel (IK-file) via the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> prior to calling this
   routine.
 </PRE>
<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>
<PRE>
   This routine provides a common interface to retrieving
   the geometric characteristics of an instrument field of
   view for a wide variety of remote sensing instruments
   across many different space missions.

   Given the NAIF instrument ID, (and having &quot;loaded&quot; the
   instrument field of view description via the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>)
   this routine returns the bore-sight of the instrument, the
   &quot;shape&quot; of the field of view, a collection of vectors
   that point along the edges of the field of view, and the
   name of the reference frame in which these vectors are defined.

   Currently this routine supports two classes of specifications
   for FOV definitions: &quot;corners&quot; and &quot;angles&quot;.

   The &quot;corners&quot; specification requires the following keywords
   defining the shape, boresight, boundary vectors, and reference
   frame of the FOV be provided in one of the text kernel files
   (normally an IK file) loaded into the kernel pool (in the
   keywords below &lt;INSTID&gt; is replaced with the instrument ID as
   passed into the module):

      INS&lt;INSTID&gt;_FOV_CLASS_SPEC         must be set to 'CORNERS' or
                                         omitted to indicate the

                                         defining the corners of the
                                         FOV in the FOV frame
                                         specified in the FOV_FRAME
                                         keyword.

   The &quot;angles&quot; specification requires the following keywords
   defining the shape, boresight, reference vector, reference and
   cross angular extents of the FOV be provided in one of the text
   kernel files (normally an IK file) loaded into the kernel

                                         Any angular units
                                         recognized by <a href="convrt_c.html">convrt_c</a> are
                                         acceptable.

   This routine is intended to be an intermediate level routine.
   It is expected that users of this routine will be familiar
   with the SPICE frames subsystem and will be comfortable writing
   software to further manipulate the vectors retrieved by this
   routine.

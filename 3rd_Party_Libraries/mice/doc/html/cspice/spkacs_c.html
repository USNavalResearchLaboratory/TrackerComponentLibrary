   targ        is the NAIF ID code for a target body. The target 
               and observer define a state vector whose position 
               component points from the observer to the target. 
 
   et          is the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past 
               J2000 TDB, at which the state of the target body 
               relative to the observer is to be computed. `et' 
               refers to time at the observer's location. 
 
   ref         is the inertial reference frame with respect to which 
               the output state `starg' is expressed. `ref' must be 
               recognized by the CSPICE Toolkit. The acceptable 
               frames are listed in the Frames Required Reading, as 
               well as in the CSPICE routine chgirf_. 
 
               Case and blanks are not significant in the string 
               `ref'. 
 
   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied 
               to the state of the target body to account for one-way 
               light time and stellar aberration. See the discussion 
               in the Particulars section for recommendations on  
               how to choose aberration corrections. 
                 
               `abcorr' may be any of the following: 
 
                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the  
                             geometric state of the target body  
                             relative to the observer.  
 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the 
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the 
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch 
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et': 
 
                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also 
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a 
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction 
                             yields the state of the target at the 
                             moment it emitted photons arriving at 
                             the observer at `et'. 
 
                             The light time correction uses an 
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation (see Particulars for details). 
                             The solution invoked by the &quot;LT&quot; option 
                             uses one iteration. 
 
                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and 
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian 
                             formulation. This option modifies the 
                             state obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to 
                             account for the observer's velocity 
                             relative to the solar system 
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent 
                             state of the target---the position and 
                             velocity of the target as seen by the 
                             observer. 
 
                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equation, the &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates
                             until the solution converges (three
                             iterations on all supported platforms).
                             Whether the &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is
                             substantially more accurate than the
                             &quot;LT&quot; solution depends on the geometry
                             of the participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed. See the Particulars section of
                             <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a discussion of precision of
                             light time corrections.

                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction and stellar aberration
                             correction.
 
 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the 
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from 
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the 
               target's location at the light-time corrected epoch 
               et+lt: 
 
                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for 
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian 
                             formulation. This correction yields the 
                             state of the target at the moment it 
                             receives photons emitted from the 
                             observer's location at `et'. 
 
                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for 
                             one-way light time and stellar 
                             aberration using a Newtonian 
                             formulation  This option modifies the 
                             state obtained with the &quot;XLT&quot; option to 
                             account for the observer's velocity 
                             relative to the solar system 
                             barycenter. The position component of 
                             the computed target state indicates the 
                             direction that photons emitted from the 
                             observer's location must be &quot;aimed&quot; to 
                             hit the target. 
 
                  &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged  
                             Newtonian light time correction. 
 
                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged Newtonian
                             light time correction and stellar
                             aberration correction.
 
 
   obs         is the NAIF ID code for the observer body. The 
               target and observer define a state vector whose 
               position component points from the observer to the 
               target. 
 </PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>

   starg       is a Cartesian state vector representing the position 
               and velocity of the target body relative to the 
               specified observer. `starg' is corrected for the 
               specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect 
               to the specified inertial reference frame. The first 
               three components of `starg' represent the x-, y- and 
               z-components of the target's position; last three 
               components form the corresponding velocity vector. 
 
               The position component of `starg' points from the 
               observer's location at `et' to the aberration-corrected 
               location of the target. Note that the sense of the 
               position vector is independent of the direction of 
               radiation travel implied by the aberration 
               correction. 
 
               Units are always km and km/sec. 
 
   lt          is the one-way light time between the observer and 
               target in seconds. If the target state is corrected 
               for aberrations, then `lt' is the one-way light time  
               between the observer and the light time corrected  
               target location. 
 
   dlt         is the derivative with respect to barycentric 
               dynamical time of the one way light time between 
               target and observer: 
 
                  dlt = d(lt)/d(et) 
 
               `dlt' can also be described as the rate of change of  
               one way light time. `dlt' is unitless, since `lt' and 
               `et' both have units of TDB seconds. 
 
               If the observer and target are at the same position, 
               then `dlt' is set to zero.

   1) If the value of `abcorr' is not recognized, the error is 
      diagnosed by a routine in the call tree of this routine.
 
   2) If the reference frame requested is not a recognized
      inertial reference frame, the error SPICE(BADFRAME)  
      is signaled. 
 
   3) If the state of the target relative to the solar system 
      barycenter cannot be computed, the error will be diagnosed  
      by routines in the call tree of this routine. 
 
   4) If the observer and target are at the same position, 
      then `dlt' is set to zero. This situation could arise, 
      for example, when the observer is Mars and the target 
      is the Mars barycenter. 
 
   6) The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if either of the input
      strings `ref' or `abcorr' do not contain at least one character,
      since such an input string cannot be converted to a Fortran-style
      string.
      
   7) The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if either of the input 
      string pointers `ref' or `abcorr' are null.

   This routine computes states using SPK files that have been 
   loaded into the SPICE system, normally via the kernel loading 
   interface routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. Application programs typically load 
   kernels once before this routine is called, for example during 
   program initialization; kernels need not be loaded repeatedly. 
   See the routine <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> and the SPK and KERNEL Required Reading 
   for further information on loading (and unloading) kernels. 
 
   If any of the ephemeris data used to compute `starg' are expressed 
   relative to a non-inertial frame in the SPK files providing those 
   data, additional kernels may be needed to enable the reference 
   frame transformations required to compute the state. Normally 
   these additional kernels are PCK files or frame kernels. Any 
   such kernels must already be loaded at the time this routine is 
   called.

   1) Look up a sequence of states of the Moon as seen from the
      Earth. Use light time and stellar aberration corrections.
      Compute the first state for the epoch 2000 JAN 1 12:00:00 TDB;
      compute subsequent states at intervals of 1 hour. For each
      epoch, display the states, the one way light time between

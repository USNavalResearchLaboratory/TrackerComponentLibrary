   occtyp     indicates the type of occultation that is to be found. 
              Note that transits are considered to be a type of
              occultation.

              Supported values and corresponding definitions are: 
 
                 &quot;FULL&quot;               denotes the full occultation 
                                      of the body designated by  
                                      `back' by the body designated 
                                      by `front', as seen from 
                                      the location of the observer. 
                                      In other words, the occulted 
                                      body is completely invisible 
                                      as seen from the observer's 
                                      location. 
 
                 &quot;ANNULAR&quot;            denotes an annular 
                                      occultation: the body 
                                      designated by `front' blocks 
                                      part of, but not the limb of, 
                                      the body designated by `back', 
                                      as seen from the location of 
                                      the observer. 
 
                 &quot;PARTIAL&quot;            denotes a partial, non-annular
                                      occultation: the body designated
                                      by `front' blocks part, but not
                                      all, of the limb of the body
                                      designated by `back', as seen
                                      from the location of the
                                      observer.
 
                 &quot;ANY&quot;                denotes any of the above three 
                                      types of occultations: 
                                      &quot;PARTIAL&quot;, &quot;ANNULAR&quot;, or 
                                      &quot;FULL&quot;. 
 
                                      &quot;ANY&quot; should be used to search 
                                      for times when the body  
                                      designated by `front' blocks 
                                      any part of the body designated 
                                      by `back'. 
 
                                      The option &quot;ANY&quot; must be used 
                                      if either the front or back 
                                      target body is modeled as 
                                      a point. 
 
              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not 
              significant in the string `occtyp'. 
 
 
   front      is the name of the target body that occults---that is, 
              passes in front of---the other. Optionally, you may 
              supply the integer NAIF ID code for the body as a 
              string. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are 
              legitimate strings that designate the Moon. 
 
              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not 
              significant in the string `front'. 
 
 
   fshape     is a string indicating the geometric model used to
              represent the shape of the front target body. The
              supported options are:
 
                 &quot;ELLIPSOID&quot;     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model
                                 with radius values provided via the 
                                 kernel pool. A kernel variable  
                                 having a name of the form 
 
                                    &quot;BODYnnn_RADII&quot;  
 
                                 where nnn represents the NAIF 
                                 integer code associated with the 
                                 body, must be present in the kernel 
                                 pool. This variable must be 
                                 associated with three numeric 
                                 values giving the lengths of the 
                                 ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes. 
 
                 &quot;POINT&quot;         Treat the body as a single point. 
                                 When a point target is specified, 
                                 the occultation type must be 
                                 set to &quot;ANY&quot;. 
                                  
              At least one of the target bodies `front' and `back' must 
              be modeled as an ellipsoid. 
 
              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not 
              significant in the string `fshape'. 
 
 
   fframe     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference 
              frame associated with the front target body. Examples 
              of such names are &quot;IAU_SATURN&quot; (for Saturn) and 
              &quot;ITRF93&quot; (for the Earth). 
 
              If the front target body is modeled as a point, `fframe' 
              should be left empty or blank. 
 
              Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
              non-blank frame name are not significant in the string
              `fframe'.

 
   back       is the name of the target body that is occulted 
              by---that is, passes in back of---the other. 
              Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code 
              for the body as a string. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and 
              &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings that designate the Moon. 
 
              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not 
              significant in the string `back'. 
 
 
   bshape     is the shape specification for the body designated by
              `back'. The supported options are those for `fshape'. See
              the description of `fshape' above for details.
               
 
   bframe     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference 
              frame associated with the ``back'' target body. 
              Examples of such names are &quot;IAU_SATURN&quot; (for Saturn) 
              and &quot;ITRF93&quot; (for the Earth). 
 
              If the back target body is modeled as a point, `bframe' 
              should be left empty or blank. 
 
              Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a 
              non-blank frame name are not significant in the string 
              `bframe'. 
 
 
   abcorr     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to 
              the state of each target body to account for one-way 
              light time.  Stellar aberration corrections are 
              ignored if specified, since these corrections don't 
              improve the accuracy of the occultation determination. 
 
              See the header of the SPICE routine <a href="spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> for a 
              detailed description of the aberration correction 
              options. For convenience, the options supported by 
              this routine are listed below: 
 
                 &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction.    
 
                 &quot;LT&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  correct for 
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian 
                            formulation. 
 
                 &quot;CN&quot;       &quot;Reception&quot; case:  converged 
                            Newtonian light time correction. 
 
                 &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for 
                            one-way light time using a Newtonian 
                            formulation. 
 
                 &quot;XCN&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged 
                            Newtonian light time correction. 
 
              Case and blanks are not significant in the string 
              `abcorr'. 
 
 
   obsrvr     is the name of the body from which the occultation is 
              observed. Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF 
              ID code for the body as a string. 
 
              Case and leading or trailing blanks are not 
              significant in the string `obsrvr'. 


   step       is the step size to be used in the search. `step' must 
              be shorter than any interval, within the confinement 
              window, over which the specified condition is met. In
              other words, `step' must be shorter than the shortest
              occultation event that the user wishes to detect; `step'
              must also be shorter than the shortest time interval
              between two occultation events that occur within the
              confinement window (see below). However, `step' must not
              be *too* short, or the search will take an unreasonable
              amount of time.
 
              The choice of `step' affects the completeness but not the
              precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance. See
              the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
              details.
 
              `step' has units of TDB seconds.  
 
  
   cnfine     is a SPICE window that confines the time period over 
              which the specified search is conducted. `cnfine' may 
              consist of a single interval or a collection of  
              intervals.  
 
              The endpoints of the time intervals comprising `cnfine'
              are interpreted as seconds past J2000 TDB.
                
              See the Examples section below for a code example  
              that shows how to create a confinement window. 
 
 </PRE>
<h4><a name="Detailed_Output">Detailed_Output</a></h4>
<PRE>
 
   cnfine     is the input confinement window, updated if necessary
              so the control area of its data array indicates the
              window's size and cardinality. The window data are
              unchanged.


   result     is a SPICE window representing the set of time 
              intervals, within the confinement period, when the

   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL     

              is the convergence tolerance used for finding endpoints
              of the intervals comprising the result window.
              SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is used to determine when binary searches
              for roots should terminate: when a root is bracketed
              within an interval of length SPICE_GF_CNVTOL, the root is
              considered to have been found.
 
              The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found 
              by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input 
              data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be 
              inferior to their precision. 
 
              SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is declared in the header file

   1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results, 
       the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand. 
       Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss 
       roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine 
       to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious 
       roots. 
 
       This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except 
       that if the step size is non-positive, the error  
       SPICE(INVALIDSTEPSIZE) will be signaled. 
 
   2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

       where nnn represents the NAIF integer code associated with 
       the body, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in the 
       call tree of this routine. 
 
   5)  If either of the target bodies `front' or `back' coincides with

   Appropriate SPICE kernels must be loaded by the calling program
   before this routine is called.
 
   The following data are required: 
 
      - SPK data: the calling application must load ephemeris data 
        for the target, source and observer that cover the time 
        period specified by the window `cnfine'. If aberration 
        corrections are used, the states of target and observer 
        relative to the solar system barycenter must be calculable 
        from the available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data 
        are made available by loading one or more SPK files via 
        <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - PCK data: bodies modeled as triaxial ellipsoids must have 
        semi-axis lengths provided by variables in the kernel pool. 
        Typically these data are made available by loading a text 
        PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - FK data: if either of the reference frames designated by
        `bframe' or `fframe' are not built in to the SPICE system,
        one or more FKs specifying these frames must be loaded. 

   Kernel data are normally loaded once per program run, NOT every time
   this routine is called.

   This routine provides a simpler, but less flexible, interface 
   than does the CSPICE routine <a href="gfocce_c.html">gfocce_c</a> for conducting searches for 
   occultation events. Applications that require support for 
   progress reporting, interrupt handling, non-default step or 
   refinement functions, or non-default convergence tolerance should 
   call <a href="gfocce_c.html">gfocce_c</a> rather than this routine. 
 
   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals 
   within the confinement window when a specified type of 
   occultation occurs. The resulting set of intervals is returned as 
   a SPICE window. 
 
   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's 
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient 
   use of this routine in user applications. 
    
 
   The Search Process 
   ================== 
 
   The search for occultations is treated as a search for state 
   transitions: times are sought when the state of the `back' body 
   changes from &quot;not occulted&quot; to &quot;occulted&quot; or vice versa. 
 
   Step Size 
   ========= 
 
   Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
   first, the input step size is used to determine the time separation
   at which the occultation state will be sampled. Starting at the left
   endpoint of the interval, samples of the occultation state will be
   taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has been
   bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the state
   change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for example, via
   binary search.
 
   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths 
   of the intervals over which the occultation state is constant: 
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest occultation 
   duration and the shortest period between occultations, within 
   the confinement window. 
 
   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and 
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size. 
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by 
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation 
   time. 
 
   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which 
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed. 
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance. 
 
 
   Convergence Tolerance 
   ===================== 
 
   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie. This
   refinement process terminates when the location of the root has been
   determined to within an error margin called the &quot;convergence
   tolerance.&quot; The convergence tolerance used by this routine is set
   via the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL.
 
   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
   tolerance doesn't limit the accuracy of solutions found by this
   routine. In general the accuracy of input data will be the limiting
   factor.
 
   To use a different tolerance value, a lower-level GF routine such as
   <a href="gfocce_c.html">gfocce_c</a> must be called. Making the tolerance tighter than
   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be useful, since the results are
   unlikely to be more accurate. Making the tolerance looser will speed
   up searches somewhat, since a few convergence steps will be omitted.
   However, in most cases, the step size is likely to have a much
   greater effect on processing time than would the convergence
   tolerance.
 
 
   The Confinement Window 
   ====================== 
 
   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time 
   interval within which a solution is sought. 

   The confinement window also can be used to restrict a search to
   a time window over which required data (typically ephemeris
   data, in the case of occultation searches) are known to be
   available.

   In some cases, the confinement window be used to make searches
   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
   slow search of interest must be performed. See the &quot;CASCADE&quot;
   example program in gf.req for a demonstration.

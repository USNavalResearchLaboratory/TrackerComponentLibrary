   method      is a short string providing parameters defining
               the computation method to be used. Parameters
               include, but are not limited to, the shape model
               used to represent the surface of the target body.

               The only choice currently supported is

                  &quot;Ellipsoid&quot;        The illumination angle computation
                                     uses a triaxial ellipsoid to model
                                     the surface of the target body.
                                     The ellipsoid's radii must be
                                     available in the kernel pool.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `method'. For example, the string ' eLLipsoid ' is
               valid.
   

   target      is the name of the target body. `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply
               a string containing the integer ID code for the object.
               For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings
               that indicate the Moon is the target body.

 
   et          is the epoch, specified as ephemeris seconds past J2000
               TDB, at which the apparent illumination angles at the
               specified surface point on the target body, as seen from
               the observing body, are to be computed.

 
   fixref      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
               frame associated with the target body. The input surface
               point `spoint' and the output vector `srfvec' are
               expressed relative to this reference frame. The string
               `fixref' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `fixref' are not significant.
 

   abcorr      is the aberration correction to be used in computing the
               position and orientation of the target body and the
               location of the Sun.

               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
               illumination angles seen by the observer are desired,
               normally either of the corrections

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;
                  &quot;CN+S&quot;

               should be used. These and the other supported options
               are described below. `abcorr' may be any of the
               following:

                  &quot;NONE&quot;     No aberration correction.

 
               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and `spoint' (note: NOT between the observer
               and the target body's center). The following values of
               `abcorr' apply to the &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons
               depart from `spoint' at the light-time corrected epoch
               et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at `et':
 
                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct both the position of `spoint' as
                             seen by the observer, and the position of
                             the Sun as seen by the target, for light
                             time.

                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct both the position of `spoint' as
                             seen by the observer, and the position of
                             the Sun as seen by the target, for light
                             time and stellar aberration.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time correction.
                             In solving the light time equations for
                             target and the Sun, the &quot;CN&quot; correction
                             iterates until the solution converges.

                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time and
                             stellar aberration corrections. This
                             option produces a solution that is at
                             least as accurate at that obtainable
                             with the &quot;LT+S&quot; option. Whether the
                             &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is substantially more
                             accurate depends on the geometry of the
                             participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `abcorr'. For example, the string

                 &quot;Lt + s&quot;

               is valid.


   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body.  This is typically a
               spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the earth.
               `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you
               may supply a string containing the integer ID code for
               the object. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are
               legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
               observer.
 
               `obsrvr' may be not be identical to `target'.


   spoint      is a surface point on the target body, expressed in
               Cartesian coordinates, relative to the body-fixed
               target frame designated by `fixref'.

               `spoint' need not be visible from the observer's
               location at the epoch `et'.

               The components of `spoint' have units of km.

<PRE>
 
   trgepc      is the &quot;surface point point epoch.&quot; `trgepc' is defined
               as follows: letting `lt' be the one-way light time
               between the observer and the input surface point
               `spoint', `trgepc' is either the epoch et-lt or `et'
               depending on whether the requested aberration correction
               is, respectively, for received radiation or omitted.
               `lt' is computed using the method indicated by `abcorr'.
 
               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.
 
 
   srfvec      is the vector from the observer's position at `et' to
               the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
               position of `spoint', where the aberration corrections
               are specified by `abcorr'. `srfvec' is expressed in the
               target body-fixed reference frame designated by
               `fixref', evaluated at `trgepc'.
 
               The components of `srfvec' are given in units of km. 
 
               One can use the CSPICE function <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> to obtain the 
               distance between the observer and `spoint': 
 
                  dist = <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> ( srfvec );
 
               The observer's position `obspos', relative to the 
               target body's center, where the center's position is 
               corrected for aberration effects as indicated by 
               `abcorr', can be computed via the call: 
 
                  <a href="vsub_c.html">vsub_c</a> ( spoint, srfvec, obspos );

               To transform the vector `srfvec' from a reference frame
               `fixref' at time `trgepc' to a time-dependant reference
               frame `ref' at time `et', the routine <a href="pxfrm2_c.html">pxfrm2_c</a> should be
               called. Let `xform' be the 3x3 matrix representing the
               rotation from the reference frame `fixref' at time
               `trgepc' to the reference frame `ref' at time `et'. Then
               `srfvec' can be transformed to the result `refvec' as
               follows:
 
                  <a href="pxfrm2_c.html">pxfrm2_c</a> ( fixref, ref,    trgepc, et, xform );
                  <a href="mxv_c.html">mxv_c</a>    ( xform,  srfvec, refvec            );

 
   phase       is the phase angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr' at
               time `et'. This is the angle between the spoint-obsrvr
               vector and the spoint-sun vector. Units are radians. The
               range of `phase' is [0, pi]. See Particulars below for a
               detailed discussion of the definition.
 

   solar       is the solar incidence angle at `spoint', as seen from
               `obsrvr' at time `et'. This is the angle between the
               surface normal vector at `spoint' and the spoint-sun
               vector. Units are radians. The range of `solar' is [0,
               pi]. See Particulars below for a detailed discussion of
               the definition.
 
 
   emissn      is the emission angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr'
               at time `et'. This is the angle between the surface
               normal vector at `spoint' and the spoint-observer
               vector. Units are radians. The range of `emissn' is [0,
               pi]. See Particulars below for a detailed discussion of
               the definition.

   1)  If the specified aberration correction is relativistic or
       calls for stellar aberration but not light time correction,
       the error SPICE(NOTSUPPORTED) is signaled. If the specified 
       aberration correction is any other unrecognized value, the 
       error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call 
       tree of this routine.  

   2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be
       converted to an integer ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND)
       is signaled.
 
   3)  If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID code, 
       the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled. 
 
   4)  If the input target body-fixed frame `fixref' is not recognized,
       the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame name may fail
       to be recognized because a required frame specification kernel
       has not been loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the 
       frame name.
 
   5)  If the input frame `fixref' is not centered at the target body,
       the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled.

   6)  If the input argument `method' is not recognized, the error 
       SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled. 

   7)  If the target and observer have distinct identities but are
       at the same location (for example, the target is Mars and
       the observer is the Mars barycenter), the error 
       SPICE(NOSEPARATION) is signaled.

   8)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to 
       calling <b>ilumin_c</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a 
       routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when 
       light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data 
       must be available to propagate the states of observer,
       target, and the Sun to the solar system barycenter. 
 
   9)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target shape
       and triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded 
       into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>ilumin_c</b>, the error will 
       be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of 
       this routine. 
 
   10) The target must be an extended body: if any of the radii of  
       the target body are non-positive, the error will be diagnosed 
       and signaled by routines in the call tree of this routine. 
  
   11) If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame orientation
       have not been loaded prior to calling <b>ilumin_c</b>, the error will 
       be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of 
       this routine. 

   12) The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if any input string
       argument does not contain at least one character, since the
       input string cannot be converted to a Fortran-style string in
       this case.
      
   13) The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if any input
       string argument pointer is null.

        Sun must be loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the
        states of target, observer, and the Sun relative to the
        solar system barycenter must be calculable from the
        available ephemeris data. Typically ephemeris data are made
        available by loading one or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

      - PCK data: if the target body shape is modeled as an
        ellipsoid, triaxial radii for the target body must be loaded
        into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by loading a
        text PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

      - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must be
        loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK file.

      - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert the
        observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of the
        target, that definition must be available in the kernel
        pool. Typically the definition is supplied by loading a
        frame kernel via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to following set of
   angles:


      phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                               surface point to the observer and from
                               the surface point to the Sun.

      solar incidence angle    Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               Sun.

      emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               observer.


   The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships
   defining these angles. The labels for the solar incidence,
   emission, and phase angles are &quot;s.i.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.

    (observer)         location


   Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
   at the surface point, and the target-sun vector are coplanar,
   then phase is the sum of incidence and emission. This is rarely
   true; usually

      phase angle  &lt;  solar incidence angle + emission angle

   All of the above angles can be computed using light time
   corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or
   no aberration corrections. In order to describe apparent
   geometry as observed by a remote sensing instrument, both
   light time and stellar aberration corrections should be used.

   The way aberration corrections are applied by this routine
   is described below.

      Light time corrections
      ======================

         Observer-target surface point body vector
         -----------------------------------------

         Let `et' be the epoch at which an observation or remote
         sensing measurement is made, and let et - lt (&quot;lt&quot; stands
         for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons
         received at `et' were emitted from the surface point `spoint'.
         Note that the light time between the surface point and
         observer will generally differ from the light time between
         the target body's center and the observer.


         Target body's orientation
         -------------------------

         Using the definitions of `et' and `lt' above, the target body's
         orientation at et-lt is used. The surface normal is
         dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's
         orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch.


         Target body -- Sun vector
         -------------------------

         The surface features on the target body near `spoint' will
         appear in a measurement made at `et' as they were at et-lt. In
         particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on the
         apparent location of the Sun as seen from the target body at
         et-lt. So, a second light time correction is used to compute
         the position of the Sun relative to the surface point.


      Stellar aberration corrections
      ==============================

      Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if
      light time corrections are applied as well.

         Observer-target surface point vector
         ------------------------------------

         When stellar aberration correction is performed, the direction
         vector `srfvec' is adjusted so as to point to the apparent
         position of `spoint': considering `spoint' to be an ephemeris
         object, `srfvec' points from the observer's position at `et'
         to the light time and stellar aberration corrected position of
         `spoint'.

         Target body-Sun vector
         ----------------------

         The target body-Sun vector is the apparent position of the
         Sun, corrected for light time and stellar aberration, as
         seen from the target body at time et-lt.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

   
   1) Find the phase, solar incidence, and emission angles at the
      sub-solar and sub-spacecraft points on Mars as seen from the Mars
      Global Surveyor spacecraft at a user-specified UTC time. Use
      light time and stellar aberration corrections.

              The calling sequence for &quot;udfuns&quot; is:

                 udfuns ( et, &amp;value )

              where:

                 et      a double precision value representing

              Note, &quot;udfunb&quot; need not call &quot;udfuns.&quot; The use of &quot;udfuns&quot;
              is determined by the needs of the calculation and
              the user's design.

   step       the double precision time step size to use in
              the search.

              `step' must be shorter than any interval, within the
              confinement window, over which the user defined boolean
              function is met. In other words, `step' must be shorter
              than the shortest time interval for which the boolean
              function is true; `step' must also be shorter than the
              shortest time interval between two boolean function true events
              occurring within the confinement window (see below).
              However, `step' must not be *too* short, or the search
              will take an unreasonable amount of time.

              The choice of `step' affects the completeness but not
              the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
              precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
              See the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
              details.

              `step' has units of TDB seconds.

   cnfine     a double precision SPICE window that confines the time
              period over which the specified search is conducted.
              cnfine may consist of a single interval or a collection
              of intervals.

              In some cases the confinement window can be used to
              greatly reduce the time period that must be searched
              for the desired solution. See the Particulars section
              below for further discussion.

              See the Examples section below for a code example
              that shows how to create a confinement window.

   cnfine     is the input confinement window, updated if necessary
              so the control area of its data array indicates the
              window's size and cardinality. The window data are
              unchanged.

   result     is a SPICE window representing the set of time
              intervals, within the confinement period, when the
              specified geometric event occurs.

              If `result' is non-empty on input, its contents
              will be discarded before <a href="gfuds_c.html">gfuds_c</a> conducts its

   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL

               is the convergence tolerance used for finding endpoints
               of the intervals comprising the result window.
               SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is used to determine when binary
               searches for roots should terminate: when a root is
               bracketed within an interval of length SPICE_GF_CNVTOL,
               the root is considered to have been found.

               The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found by
               this routine depends on the accuracy of the input data.
               In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be
               inferior to their precision.

               SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is declared in the header file
               SpiceGF.h.

   1)  In order for this routine to produce correct results,
       the step size must be appropriate for the problem at hand.
       Step sizes that are too large may cause this routine to miss
       roots; step sizes that are too small may cause this routine
       to run unacceptably slowly and in some cases, find spurious
       roots.

       This routine does not diagnose invalid step sizes, except
       that if the step size is non-positive, an error is signaled
       by a routine in the call tree of this routine.

   2)  Due to numerical errors, in particular,

          - Truncation error in time values
          - Finite tolerance value
          - Errors in computed geometric quantities

       it is *normal* for the condition of interest to not always be
       satisfied near the endpoints of the intervals comprising the
       result window.

       The result window may need to be contracted slightly by the
       caller to achieve desired results. The SPICE window routine
       <a href="wncond_c.html">wncond_c</a> can be used to contract the result window.

   3)  If an error (typically cell overflow) occurs while performing
       window arithmetic, the error will be diagnosed by a routine
       in the call tree of this routine.

   4)  If required ephemerides or other kernel data are not
       available, an error is signaled by a routine in the call tree
       of this routine.

   5) If the output SPICE window `result' has insufficient capacity to
      contain the number of intervals on which the specified geometric
      condition is met, the error will be diagnosed by a routine in
      the call tree of this routine. If the result window has size
      less than 2, the error SPICE(INVALIDDIMENSION) will signal.

   6) If either input cell has type other than SpiceDouble,
      the error SPICE(TYPEMISMATCH) will signaled from a routine
      in the call tree of this routine.

   Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
   this routine is called.

   If the user defined function requires access to ephemeris data:

      - SPK data: ephemeris data for any body over the
        time period defined by the confinement window must be
        loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter
        must be calculable from the available ephemeris data.
        Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one
        or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.

      - If non-inertial reference frames are used, then PCK
        files, frame kernels, C-kernels, and SCLK kernels may be
        needed.

   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.
</PRE>
<h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4>
<PRE>
   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals
   within the confinement window when the boolean function
   evaluates to true. The resulting set of intervals is returned
   as a SPICE window.

   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient
   use of this routine in user applications.


   udfuns Default Template
   =======================

   The boolean function includes an argument for an input scalar
   function. Use of a scalar function during the evaluation of
   the boolean function is not required. SPICE provides a no-op
   scalar routine, <a href="udf_c.html">udf_c</a>, as a dummy argument for instances when
   the boolean function does not need to call the scalar function.


   The Search Process
   ==================

   The search for boolean events is treated as a search for state
   transitions: times are sought when the boolean function value
   changes from true to false or vice versa.


   Step Size
   =========

   Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows:
   first, the input step size is used to determine the time
   separation at which the boolean function will be sampled.
   Starting at the left endpoint of the interval, samples of the
   boolean function will be taken at each step. If a state change
   is detected, a root has been bracketed; at that point, the
   &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the state change occurs---is found by a
   refinement process, for example, via binary search.

   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths
   of the intervals over which the boolean function is constant:
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest such interval
   and the shortest separation between the intervals, within
   the confinement window.

   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size.
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation
   time.

   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed.
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance.


   Convergence Tolerance
   =====================

   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
   This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
   has been determined to within an error margin called the
   &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The convergence tolerance used by this
   routine is set via the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL.

   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the
   tolerance doesn't limit the accuracy of solutions found by this
   routine. In general the accuracy of input data will be the limiting
   factor.

   The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default
   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="gfstol_c.html">gfstol_c</a>, e.g.

      <a href="gfstol_c.html">gfstol_c</a>( tolerance value )

   Call <a href="gfstol_c.html">gfstol_c</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent
   searches will use the updated reference value.

   Setting the tolerance tighter than SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be
   useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate.
   Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat,
   since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most
   cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater effect
   on processing time than would the convergence tolerance.


   The Confinement Window
   ======================

   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time
   interval within which a solution is sought.

   The confinement window also can be used to restrict a search to
   a time window over which required data are known to be
   available.

   In some cases, the confinement window can be used to make searches
   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search
   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively
   slow search of interest must be performed. See the &quot;CASCADE&quot;
   example program in gf.req for a demonstration.

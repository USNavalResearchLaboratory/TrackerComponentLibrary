   method      is a short string providing parameters defining 
               the computation method to be used.
 
               The only choice currently supported is 
 
                  &quot;Ellipsoid&quot;        The intercept computation uses 
                                     a triaxial ellipsoid to model 
                                     the surface of the target body. 
                                     The ellipsoid's radii must be 
                                     available in the kernel pool. 
 
               Neither case nor white space are significant in  
               `method'. For example, the string ' eLLipsoid ' is  
               valid.                  

                
   target      is the name of the target body. `target' is 
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in 
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may 
               supply a string containing the integer ID code  
               for the object. For example both &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; 
               are legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the 
               target body. 
 
               When the target body's surface is represented by a 
               tri-axial ellipsoid, this routine assumes that a 
               kernel variable representing the ellipsoid's radii is 
               present in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel 
               variable would be defined by loading a PCK file. 
 
 
   et          is the epoch of participation of the observer, 
               expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: `et' is 
               the epoch at which the observer's state is computed. 
 
               When aberration corrections are not used, `et' is also 
               the epoch at which the position and orientation of the 
               target body are computed. 
 
               When aberration corrections are used, the position and
               orientation of the target body are computed at et-lt or
               et+lt, where `lt' is the one-way light time between the
               intercept point and the observer, and the sign applied
               to `lt' depends on the selected correction. See the
               description of `abcorr' below for details.
 
                                 
   fixref      is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered 
               reference frame associated with the target body. The 
               output intercept point `spoint' and the observer to 
               intercept vector `srfvec' will be expressed relative to 
               this reference frame. 
 
 
   abcorr      indicates the aberration corrections to be applied when
               computing the target's position and orientation.
 
               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
               target surface intercept point seen by the observer is
               desired, normally the correction
             
                  &quot;CN+S&quot; 
    
               should be used. This and the other supported options 
               are described below. `abcorr' may be any of the  
               following: 
 
                  &quot;NONE&quot;     Apply no correction. Return the  
                             geometric surface intercept point on the 
                             target body. 
 
               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the 
               observer and the surface intercept point (note: NOT 
               between the observer and the target body's center). 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the 
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the 
               intercept point's location at the light-time 
               corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's 
               location at `et': 
 
 
                  &quot;LT&quot;       Correct for one-way light time (also 
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a 
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction 
                             yields the location of the surface 
                             intercept point at the moment it 
                             emitted photons arriving at the 
                             observer at `et'. 
  
                             The light time correction uses an 
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation. The solution invoked by the 
                             &quot;LT&quot; option uses one iteration. 
 
                             Both the target position as seen by the 
                             observer, and rotation of the target 
                             body, are corrected for light time. 
 
                  &quot;LT+S&quot;     Correct for one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian formulation.
                             This option modifies the surface intercept
                             obtained with the &quot;LT&quot; option to account
                             for the observer's velocity relative to
                             the solar system barycenter. These
                             computations yield the apparent surface
                             intercept point.

                  &quot;CN&quot;       Converged Newtonian light time correction.
                             In solving the light time equation, the
                             &quot;CN&quot; correction iterates until the
                             solution converges. Both the position and
                             rotation of the target body are corrected
                             for light time.
 
                  &quot;CN+S&quot;     Converged Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections. This option
                             produces a solution that is at least as
                             accurate at that obtainable with the &quot;LT+S&quot;
                             option. Whether the &quot;CN+S&quot; solution is
                             substantially more accurate depends on the
                             geometry of the participating objects and
                             on the accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed.
 
                             For reception-case applications involving
                             intercepts near the target body limb, this
                             option should be used
 
               The following values of `abcorr' apply to the 
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from 
               the observer's location at `et' and arrive at the 
               intercept point at the light-time corrected epoch 
               et+lt: 
 
 
                  &quot;XLT&quot;      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for 
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian 
                             formulation. This correction yields the 
                             intercept location at the moment it 
                             receives photons emitted from the 
                             observer's location at `et'.  
 
                             The light time correction uses an 
                             iterative solution of the light time 
                             equation. The solution invoked by the 
                             &quot;XLT&quot; option uses one iteration. 

                             Both the target position as seen by the 
                             observer, and rotation of the target 
                             body, are corrected for light time. 
 
                  &quot;XLT+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for 
                             one-way light time and stellar 
                             aberration using a Newtonian 
                             formulation  This option modifies the 
                             intercept obtained with the &quot;XLT&quot; 
                             option to account for the observer's 
                             velocity relative to the solar system 
                             barycenter. 
 
                  &quot;XCN&quot;      Converged Newtonian light time 
                             correction. This is the same as XLT 
                             correction but with further iterations 
                             to a converged Newtonian light time 
                             solution.  
 
                  &quot;XCN+S&quot;    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged Newtonian
                             light time and stellar aberration
                             corrections. This option produces a
                             solution that is at least as accurate at
                             that obtainable with the &quot;XLT+S&quot; option.
                             Whether the &quot;XCN+S&quot; solution is
                             substantially more accurate depends on the
                             geometry of the participating objects and
                             on the accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed.
 
                             For transmission-case applications
                             involving intercepts near the target body
                             limb, this option should be used.
 
               Case and embedded blanks are not significant in `abcorr'.
               For example, the string 

                  &quot;Cn + s&quot;

               is valid.

 
   obsrvr      is the name of the observing body. This is typically 
               a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the 
               earth. `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and 
               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. 
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the 
               integer ID code for the object. For example both 
               &quot;MOON&quot; and &quot;301&quot; are legitimate strings that indicate 
               the Moon is the observer. 
 
 
   dref        is the name of the reference frame relative to which the
               ray's direction vector is expressed. This may be any
               frame supported by the SPICE system, including built-in
               frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading) and
               frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK). The string
               `dref' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in `dref' are not significant.
 
               When `dref' designates a non-inertial frame, the 
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch 
               dependent on the frame's center and, if the center is 
               not the observer, on the selected aberration 
               correction. See the description of the direction 
               vector `dvec' for details. 
 
 
   dvec        Ray direction vector emanating from the observer. The
               intercept with the target body's surface of the ray
               defined by the observer and `dvec' is sought.
 
               `dvec' is specified relative to the reference frame 
               designated by `dref'. 
 
               Non-inertial reference frames are treated as follows: 
               if the center of the frame is at the observer's 
               location, the frame is evaluated at `et'. If the 
               frame's center is located elsewhere, then letting 
               `ltcent' be the one-way light time between the observer 
               and the central body associated with the frame, the 
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at et-ltcent, 
               et+ltcent, or `et' depending on whether the requested 
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received 
               radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted. 
               `ltcent' is computed using the method indicated by 
               `abcorr'.

   spoint      is the surface intercept point on the target body of 
               the ray defined by the observer and the direction 
               vector. If the ray intersects the target body in 
               multiple points, the selected intersection point is 
               the one closest to the observer. The output argument 
               `found' (see below) indicates whether an intercept was 
               found. 
 
               `spoint' is expressed in Cartesian coordinates, 
               relative to the target body-fixed frame designated by 
               `fixref'. The body-fixed target frame is evaluated at 
               the intercept epoch `trgepc' (see description below). 
 
               When light time correction is used, the duration of
               light travel between `spoint' to the observer is
               considered to be the one way light time. When both light
               time and stellar aberration corrections are used,
               `spoint' is selected such that, when `spoint' is
               corrected for light time an stellar aberration, `spoint'
               lies on the ray defined by the observer's location and
               `dvec'.
 
               The components of `spoint' are given in units of km. 
 
 
   trgepc      is the &quot;intercept epoch.&quot; `trgepc' is defined as
               follows: letting `lt' be the one-way light time between
               the observer and the intercept point, `trgepc' is the
               epoch et-lt, et+lt, or `et' depending on whether the
               requested aberration correction is, respectively, for
               received radiation, transmitted radiation, or omitted.
               `lt' is computed using the method indicated by `abcorr'.
 
               `trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB. 
 
 
   srfvec      is the vector from the observer's position at `et' to
               the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
               position of `spoint', where the aberration corrections
               are specified by `abcorr'. `srfvec' is expressed in the
               target body-fixed reference frame designated by
               `fixref', evaluated at `trgepc'.

               The components of `srfvec' are given in units of km. 
 
               One can use the CSPICE function <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> to obtain the 
               distance between the observer and `spoint': 
 
                  dist = <a href="vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> ( srfvec );
 
               The observer's position `obspos', relative to the 
               target body's center, where the center's position is 
               corrected for aberration effects as indicated by 
               `abcorr', can be computed via the call: 
 
                  <a href="vsub_c.html">vsub_c</a> ( spoint, srfvec, obspos );
 
               To transform the vector `srfvec' from a reference frame
               `fixref' at time `trgepc' to a time-dependent reference
               frame `ref' at time `et', the routine <a href="pxfrm2_c.html">pxfrm2_c</a> should be
               called. Let `xform' be the 3x3 matrix representing the
               rotation from the reference frame `fixref' at time
               `trgepc' to the reference frame `ref' at time `et'. Then
               `srfvec' can be transformed to the result `refvec' as
               follows:
 
                  <a href="pxfrm2_c.html">pxfrm2_c</a> ( fixref, ref,    trgepc, et, xform );
                  <a href="mxv_c.html">mxv_c</a>    ( xform,  srfvec, refvec            );

               The second example in the Examples header section

   1)  If the specified aberration correction is unrecognized, the
       error will be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call
       tree of this routine.

   2)  If either the target or observer input strings cannot be
       converted to an integer ID code, the error SPICE(IDCODENOTFOUND)
       is signaled.
 
   3)  If `obsrvr' and `target' map to the same NAIF integer ID code, 
       the error SPICE(BODIESNOTDISTINCT) is signaled. 
 
   4)  If the input target body-fixed frame `fixref' is not recognized,
       the error SPICE(NOFRAME) is signaled. A frame name may fail
       to be recognized because a required frame specification kernel
       has not been loaded; another cause is a misspelling of the 
       frame name.
 
   5)  If the input frame `fixref' is not centered at the target body,
       the error SPICE(INVALIDFRAME) is signaled.

   6)  If the input argument `method' is not recognized, the error 
       SPICE(INVALIDMETHOD) is signaled. 

   7)  If the target and observer have distinct identities but are
       at the same location (for example, the target is Mars and
       the observer is the Mars barycenter), the error 
       SPICE(NOSEPARATION) is signaled.

   8)  If insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded prior to 
       calling <b>sincpt_c</b>, the error will be diagnosed and signaled by a 
       routine in the call tree of this routine. Note that when 
       light time correction is used, sufficient ephemeris data 
       must be available to propagate the states of both observer 
       and target to the solar system barycenter. 
 
   9)  If the computation method specifies an ellipsoidal target shape
       and triaxial radii of the target body have not been loaded 
       into the kernel pool prior to calling <b>sincpt_c</b>, the error will 
       be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of 
       this routine. 
 
   10) The target must be an extended body: if any of the radii of  
       the target body are non-positive, the error will be diagnosed 
       and signaled by routines in the call tree of this routine. 
  
   11) If PCK data specifying the target body-fixed frame orientation
       have not been loaded prior to calling <b>sincpt_c</b>, the error will 
       be diagnosed and signaled by a routine in the call tree of 
       this routine. 

   12) If the reference frame designated by `dref' is not recognized
       by the SPICE frame subsystem, the error SPICE(NOFRAME)
       will be signaled.

   13) If the direction vector `dvec' is the zero vector, the error
       SPICE(ZEROVECTOR) will be signaled.

   14) The error SPICE(EMPTYSTRING) is signaled if any input string
       argument does not contain at least one character, since the
       input string cannot be converted to a Fortran-style string in
       this case.
      
   15) The error SPICE(NULLPOINTER) is signaled if any input
       string argument pointer is null.

   Appropriate kernels must be loaded by the calling program before
   this routine is called. 
 
   The following data are required: 
 
      - SPK data: ephemeris data for target and observer must be 
        loaded. If aberration corrections are used, the states of 
        target and observer relative to the solar system barycenter 
        must be calculable from the available ephemeris data. 
        Typically ephemeris data are made available by loading one 
        or more SPK files via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - PCK data: if the computation method is specified as 
        &quot;Ellipsoid,&quot; triaxial radii for the target body must be  
        loaded into the kernel pool. Typically this is done by 
        loading a text PCK file via <a href="furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>. 
 
      - Further PCK data: rotation data for the target body must 
        be loaded. These may be provided in a text or binary PCK 
        file.  
  
   The following data may be required: 
 
      - Frame data: if a frame definition is required to convert 
        the observer and target states to the body-fixed frame of 
        the target, that definition must be available in the kernel 
        pool. Similarly, the frame definition required to map 
        between the frame designated by `dref' and the target 
        body-fixed frame must be available. Typically the 
        definitions of frames not already built-in to SPICE are 
        supplied by loading a frame kernel. 

      - CK data: if the frame to which `dref' refers is fixed to a
        spacecraft instrument or structure, at least one CK file will
        be needed to permit transformation of vectors between that
        frame and both the J2000 and the target body-fixed frames.
 
      - SCLK data: if a CK file is needed, an associated SCLK 
        kernel is required to enable conversion between encoded SCLK 
        (used to time-tag CK data) and barycentric dynamical time 
        (TDB). 
 
   In all cases, kernel data are normally loaded once per program 
   run, NOT every time this routine is called.

   Given a ray defined by a direction vector and the location of an 
   observer, <b>sincpt_c</b> computes the surface intercept point of the ray 
   on a specified target body. <b>sincpt_c</b> also determines the vector 
   from the observer to the surface intercept point. 
 
   When aberration corrections are used, this routine finds the 
   value of `spoint' such that, if `spoint' is regarded as an ephemeris 
   object, after the selected aberration corrections are applied to 
   the vector from the observer to `spoint', the resulting vector is 
   parallel to the direction vector `dvec'. 
 
   This routine computes light time corrections using light time 
   between the observer and the surface intercept point, as opposed 
   to the center of the target. Similarly, stellar aberration 
   corrections done by this routine are based on the direction of 
   the vector from the observer to the light-time corrected 
   intercept point, not to the target center. This technique avoids 
   errors due to the differential between aberration corrections 
   across the target body. Therefore it's valid to use aberration 
   corrections with this routine even when the observer is very 
   close to the intercept point, in particular when the 
   observer-intercept point distance is much less than the 
   observer-target center distance. It's also valid to use stellar 
   aberration corrections even when the intercept point is near or 
   on the limb (as may occur in occultation computations using a 
   point target). 
 
   When comparing surface intercept point computations with results 
   from sources other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the 
   same geometric definitions are used.

   The numerical results shown for this example may differ across 
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as 
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine  
   specific arithmetic implementation.  
 

   1) The following program computes surface intercept points on 
      Mars for the boresight and FOV boundary vectors of the MGS MOC
      narrow angle camera. The intercepts are computed for a single

      are used. For simplicity, camera distortion is ignored.

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>

   A cautionary note: if aberration corrections are used, and  
   if `dref' is the target body-fixed frame, the epoch at which that 
   frame is evaluated is offset from `et' by the light time between 
   the observer and the *center* of the target body. This light time 
   normally will differ from the light time between the observer and 
   intercept point. Consequently the orientation of the target 
   body-fixed frame at `trgepc' will not match that of the target 
   body-fixed frame at the epoch associated with `dref'. As a result, 
   various derived quantities may not be as expected: for example, 
   `srfvec' would not be parallel to `dvec'.
 
   In many applications the errors arising from this frame 
   discrepancy may be insignificant; however a safe approach is to 
   always use as `dref' a frame other than the target body-fixed 
   frame.

       References to the new <a href="pxfrm2_c.html">pxfrm2_c</a> routine were added, which
       changed the Detailed Output section and the second example. 

       Miscellaneous, minor header comment corrections were made.

       Typos in the Detailed Input section's description of `dref'
       were corrected. Incorrect frame name fixfrm was changed to
       fixref in documentation.

       In the header examples, meta-kernel names were updated to use
       the suffix

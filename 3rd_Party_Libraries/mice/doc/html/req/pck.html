   The Planetary Constants Kernel (PCK) subsystem provides cartographic and
   physical constants data for Solar System bodies. Mice software uses
   these data when determining observation geometry dependent on the size,
   shape, and orientation of planets, natural satellites, comets, and
   asteroids.

<H2> Introduction
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The functionality of the PCK subsystem is supplied by data files called
   ``PCK files'' (or PCKs) and by Mice subroutines that can read and
   interpret the data in these files.
<P>
 
   Historically, only one type of PCK existed, the text PCK (called the "P
   constants kernel.") These ASCII files can be easily viewed and modified
   via text editor. The current SPICE system also supports a non-ascii
   binary PCK. These files contain more precise body orientation
   information in binary format (no size and shape data). This format
   permits large amounts of data to be stored and quickly accessed. As of
   the date of this document, binary PCK files exists only for the moon,
   earth, and the asteroid Eros.
<P>
 
   The purpose of the PCK and associated software is to provide SPICE users
   a convenient mechanism for supplying planetary physical constants to
   application programs. Mice software reads files conforming to these
   formats and returns both the data contained in such files and a few
   commonly used numeric quantities derived from the kernel data.

<H3> Body Codes
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   NAIF software uses a system of integer codes to conveniently represent
   celestial bodies, locations such as barycenters, Lagrange points, and
   spacecraft. The NAIF IDS Required Reading document, <a href="../req/naif_ids.html"><a href="../req/naif_ids.html">naif_ids.req</a></a>,
   describes this system in detail.
<P>
 
   In this document, the following features of the code system will be
   relied on:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The code for the barycenter of the nth planetary system is n. The count
starts at 1, which stands for Mercury; e.g. the code for Jupiter's
barycenter is 5. The code for the Sun is 10. SPICE maintains Pluto as the
9th planet.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Epochs and Reference Frames
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Some constants that frequently appear in PCK files are associated with a
   particular epoch and with a particular reference frame. For example, PCK
   files released by NAIF typically contain constants that define the axes
   of various body-fixed planetocentric coordinate systems, given relative
   to a specified inertial reference frame, as a function of time. In this
   sort of definition, the independent variable, time, is measured relative
   to a specified reference epoch.
<P>
 
   Within Mice, reference frames are identified by short character strings
   such as 'J2000'. The names of the body-fixed reference frames are
   usually constructed by adding the prefix ``IAU_'' to the name of the
   body, for example ``IAU_MARS'' for Mars. The exception from this rule
   are body-fixed reference frames associated with high-precision
   orientation provided in binary PCK files. For more details see FRAMES
   Required Reading, <a href="../req/frames.html"><a href="../req/frames.html">frames.req</a></a>.
<P>
 
   However, Mice also has a system of integer codes used by some routines
   to specify reference frames. This coding system is also described in
   detail in <a href="../req/frames.html"><a href="../req/frames.html">frames.req</a></a>.

<H3> Planetocentric Coordinates
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The body-fixed ``Planetocentric'' coordinate system referred to in this
   document is defined for solar system bodies as follows:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The x-axis of the Planetocentric coordinate system for a specified body
lies both in the body's equatorial plane and in the plane containing the
body's prime meridian.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The z-axis is parallel to the body's mean axis of rotation and points North
of the invariable plane of the solar system (regardless of the body's spin
direction). The north pole is the pole of rotation.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> The y-axis is defined as the cross product of the z and x axes, in that
order. Thus, the frame is right-handed.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The above definition implies that the axes of a planetocentric system
   are time-varying. Thus a complete specification of the axes requires
   identification of an epoch as well as the body.

<A NAME="Using the PCK System: Overview"></A>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Using the PCK System: Overview
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   This section describes how PCK files and software are used in
   application programs.
<P>
 
   The use of PCK data in an application program requires three steps:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> Selecting the appropriate PCK file(s) for the problem.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> Reading the PCK data into the program.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> Using the data within the program.
<BR><BR></UL>
   Step 1 is not necessarily trivial since there may be no single set of
   ``best values'' for physical constants of interest; the ``best'' values
   - if such exist - depend on the problem. The user's judgment, supported
   by comments and usage notes in the PCK file, is required for this step.
<P>
 
   Step 2 is referred to as ``loading'' a PCK file. Text PCK files are
   loaded by calling the Mice subroutine <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> and supplying the
   name of the PCK file to load as the input argument or by loading a meta
   kernel that lists the PCK. All data in a text PCK file is read into
   memory when the file is loaded by an application program at run-time.
   Load binary PCKs in the same way. The program can access all loaded data
   during the program run, unless deliberately overwritten or unloaded.
   Multiple text and multiple binary PCKs can be used simultaneously.
<P>
 
   The data available from binary PCKs take precedence over that from text
   PCKs. If data for a requested planetary constant and time period is
   covered by a loaded binary PCK file, the subsystem returns and uses the
   binary data. If multiple binary PCK files are loaded, the most recently
   loaded file takes precedence, down to the binary file loaded earliest.
   The subsystem defaults to text PCK data when no binary PCK data is
   available. If the user loaded multiple text PCKs, and those PCKs
   contained variable assignments using the same variable name, the later
   loads overwrite the assignments defined by earlier loads.
<P>
 
   Step 3, using loaded PCK data, is accomplished via calls to Mice
   routines. At the lowest level, these access routines allow the calling
   program to retrieve specified data that has been read from one or more
   PCK files. Higher-level access routines can return quantities derived
   from loaded PCK data.
<P>
 
   For text PCK files, the PCK software can be thought of as ``buffering''
   all data loaded from PCK files: the data from these files is retained in
   memory. Therefore, repeated calls to the PCK access routines do not
   incur the inefficiency of re-reading data from files. For binary PCK
   file, like the case of the SPK and CK readers, only a portion of the
   most recently used information is buffered.
<P>
 
   The data structure used by Mice to maintain associations of text kernel
   variable names and values is called the ``kernel pool.'' Data loaded
   into memory via <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> is referred to as ``being present in the
   kernel pool.'' There is no analog to the kernel pool for binary PCK
   files.
<P>

<A NAME="Orientation Models used by PCK Software"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Orientation Models used by PCK Software
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The orientation models used by Mice PCK access routines all express the
   direction of the pole and location of the prime meridian of a body with
   respect to an inertial reference frame, as a function of time. This
   information defines the coordinate axes of the ``Body Equator and Prime
   Meridian'' system.
<P>
 
   The orientation models use three Euler angles to describe the pole and
   prime meridian location: the first two angles, in order, are the right
   ascension and declination (henceforth RA and DEC) of the north pole of a
   body as a function of time. The third angle is the prime meridian
   location (represented by `W'), which is expressed as a rotation about
   the north pole, also a function of time. The coordinate transformation
   defined by the Euler angles is represented by the matrix product
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [ W ]    [ Pi/2 - Dec ]    [ Pi/2 + RA ]
        3                 1                3
</PRE>
   where
<P>
 
<PRE>
   [ W ]
        i
</PRE>
   denotes the matrix that rotates a coordinate system by W radians about
   the ith coordinate axis (or rotates vectors by -W radians about the same
   axis), using the right hand rule. (This notation is explained in detail
   in <a href="../req/rotation.html"><a href="../req/rotation.html">rotation.req</a></a>).
<P>
 
   In PCK files, the time arguments of functions that define orientation
   always refer to Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), measured in centuries
   or days past a specified epoch such as J2000, which is Julian ephemeris
   date 2451545.0. The time units expected by the Mice software are
   ephemeris days for prime meridian motion and ephemeris centuries for
   motion of the pole.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H1> The Two Formats of PCK files
</H1><HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE><P><BR><BR><BR>
   There are two general forms for PCK files, text and binary files. Text
   files are ASCII and can be created and modified with an editor.
   Therefore, they are easily changed and read. Binary files are created
   via Mice programs and have a particular format and architecture. They
   cannot be examined or changed with an editor. These files require Mice
   software for their manipulation. Binary PCKs can contain more data and
   are faster to use. In the PCK case, the binary files contain higher
   precision data than the text files. Binary PCKs contain only orientation
   data, while text PCKs usually include orientation, size, and shape data,
   and may include other physical data associated with a body.

   As of the Mice N0052 release (January, 2002), supported platforms are
   able to read DAF-based binary files (SPK, CK and binary PCK) written in
   a non-native, binary representation. This access is read-only; any
   operations requiring writing to the file (adding information to the
   comment area, or appending additional ephemeris data, for example)
   require prior conversion of the file to the native binary file format.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> NAIF Text Kernel Format
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Text PCK files express data as ``assignments''; in text PCKs, values are
   associated with name strings using a ``keyword = value'' format. These
   name strings, together with their associated values, are called ``kernel
   variables.'' The Mice routines that access text PCK data at run time use
   these associations established by loaded text PCK files to reference
   desired data values; these routines look up data ``by name.'' Therefore,
   programmers writing applications that use text PCKs must coordinate use
   of kernel variable names between their software and the text PCK files
   used by their software.
<P>
 
   Text PCK files conform to a flexible format called ``NAIF text kernel''
   format. The SPICE file identification word provided by itself on the
   first line of the text PCK file is ``KPL/PCK''. Both the NAIF text
   kernel format and SPICE file identification word are described in detail
   in the Kernel Required Reading document, <a href="../req/kernel.html"><a href="../req/kernel.html">kernel.req</a></a>. For the reader's
   convenience, an overview of the NAIF text kernel format is provided
   here.
<P>
 
   NAIF text kernels are, first of all, ASCII files. As such, they are
   human readable and can be easily modified by text editors. In addition,
   NAIF text kernels can be readily ported between computer systems, even
   when the systems in question have different file systems and file
   formats.
<P>
 
   The NAIF text kernel format provides for representation of data in a
   ``keyword = value'' syntax. The format also provides for the inclusion
   of free-form comment blocks.
<P>
 
   There are two kinds of data that can be placed in NAIF text kernel
   files: double precision numbers and UTC time strings.
<P>
 
   According to the text kernel format, a text kernel nominally consists of
   a series of sets of contiguous lines (or ``blocks'') of comments,
   alternating with blocks of data. Comment blocks are started with the
   string (called a ``control sequence'')
<P>
 
<PRE>
   \begintext
</PRE>
   alone on a line, as shown here. Comment blocks are ended by the control
   sequence
<P>
 
<PRE>
   \begindata

   alone on a line. In a text kernel file, the lines preceding the first

<PRE>
   \begintext
</PRE>
   control sequence is optional for this comment block.
<P>
 
   Comment blocks can contain arbitrary text, except for non-printing
   characters or lines that can be interpreted as control sequences. On the
   other hand, data must be organized according to a very specific format:
   all of the data in a text kernel must appear in the form of an
   ``assignment'' such as
<P>
 
<PRE>
   NAME = VALUE
</PRE>
   or
<P>
 
<PRE>
   NAME = ( VALUE1, VALUE2, ... )
</PRE>
   where "NAME" is a string no longer than 32 characters, and one or more
   values appear on the right hand. A specific example is shown below:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY399_RADII     = (  6378.140  6378.140  6356.75  )
</PRE>
   The "VALUES" may be integer, double precision or string values.
<P>
 
   Some variations on the form shown here are allowed: commas between data
   values are optional, the right hand side of the assignment can be
   continued over multiple lines, and the data values can be expressed as
   integers or reals without causing the PCK software to fail. Either an
   "E" or "D" can be used to set off an exponent. Assignments of scalars do
   not require the value on the right hand side to be enclosed in
   parentheses, but that notation is frequently used as a visual cue. Blank
   lines within or between assignments are ignored by the Mice software
   that reads text kernels.
<P>
 
   In addition to numbers, UTC strings can be assigned to variables. The
   ``@'' character is used to identify the strings as time strings. The
   strings are stored internally as double precision numbers representing
   ``UTC seconds past J2000.'' An example is the assignment:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   SCLK_KERNEL_ID            = ( @01-MAY-1991/16:25 )
</PRE>
   See <a href="../req/kernel.html"><a href="../req/kernel.html">kernel.req</a></a> for a complete discussion of the allowed form of
   assignments.
<P>
 
   The effect of an assignment in a text PCK file is to associate values
   with a name. The name is referred to as a ``kernel variable.'' When a
   text PCK file is loaded by an application, the associations of names and
   values established by the PCK are maintained: the values associated with
   a given name can be retrieved at any time.

   Other than the limitations imposed by the PCK file formats, no absolute
   restrictions exist on the names or values of the variables used in PCK
   files. However, the SPICE kernel concept calls for the contents of PCK
   files to be limited to physical and cartographic constants describing
   extended solar system bodies: radii of bodies, constants defining
   orientation models, and masses or values of GM are examples of data
   appropriate for inclusion in PCKs.

   In this document, the formulas defining time-varying coordinate

   Because PCK access routines that deal with orientation models are used
   extensively in Mice and applications that use the Toolkit, the kernel
   variables that these routines rely on will be discussed in detail.
<P>
 
   Those functions defining the Euler angles are characterized by a set of
   parameters. The specific values of the parameters are values assigned to
   kernel variables in PCK files. The functions themselves are implemented

   Orientation models for natural satellites of planets are a little more
   complicated; in addition to polynomial terms, the RA, DEC, and W
   expressions include trigonometric terms. The arguments of the
   trigonometric terms are linear polynomials. These arguments are usually
   called ``phase angles.'' However, within Mice internal documentation,
   these quantities are called ``nutation precession angles''; for
   consistency with the Mice software, we'll use this terminology in the
   following discussion.

   Mice software for text PCKs expects the models for satellite orientation
   to follow the form of the model shown here: the polynomial terms in the
   RA, DEC, and W expressions are expected to be quadratic, the
   trigonometric terms for RA and W (satellite prime meridian) are expected
   to be sums of sines of nutation precession angles, and the trigonometric
   terms for DEC are expected to be sums of cosines of nutation precession
   angles. The nutation precession angles themselves are defined by linear
   polynomial functions of time.
<P>
 
   Note that the number of values defining the nutation precession angles
   for a planetary system must be consistent with the number of
   trigonometric terms used in the expressions for the RA, DEC and W angles
   for the satellites of that system. See ``Creating and Modifying Text

   Mice contains a number of geometry routines that make use of triaxial

   The text PCK file format allows NAIF Toolkit users to easily modify
   existing text PCKs and to create their own files containing values of
   their choosing. Any text editor capable of working with ASCII files can
   be used to edit text PCK files.
<P>
 
   Although the text PCK format makes it easy to modify text PCK files,
   NAIF recommends that application programmers avoid software designs that
   call for special-purpose, user-created text PCK files. The opportunities
   for confusion and errors increase with the number of available versions
   of a text PCK file (or any data file).
<P>
 
   NAIF recommends that you take the following precautions when modifying a
   text PCK file:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Change the name of the updated file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Document the changes by adding appropriate comments to the file. Each text
PCK file should contain sufficient information to allow a reader to find
out who was responsible for creating the current version of the file and
what the source was for each data value in the file. If the file is an
update, the reason for the update and a summary of the differences from the
previous version should be included.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Test the file using software that makes use of any values that you've added
or modified.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The reasons why a NAIF Toolkit user might wish to modify an existing
   text PCK are:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Removing unneeded data or comments to speed up loading and simplify the
file. Removal of data is much more important than removal of comments, as
far as speeding up kernel loading is concerned.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Adding data values for new bodies.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Updating existing data values or substituting preferred data values.
<BR><BR></UL>
   New kernel variables added to text PCK files should follow the naming
   conventions described in the ``Kernel Variable Names'' section. All text
   PCK variable names, whether or not they are recognized by Mice software,
   should start with the prefix
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODYnnn_
</PRE>
   where nnn is the NAIF integer code of the body corresponding to the
   variable.
<P>
 
   Kernel variables having names recognized by users' application software
   are a potential problem area: if the names used in the application don't
   match those in the text PCK file, the application will fail to obtain
   the data as intended. The most frequent cause of this type of failure is
   misspelling of variable names, but programmers who considering changing
   the names of PCK variables already in use should also keep this problem
   in mind.
<P>
 
   Modifying orientation models for satellites requires attention to the
   consistency between the number of nutation precession angles and the
   number of coefficients of trigonometric functions having the nutation
   precession angles as arguments. For any planetary system, there should
   be twice as many values for the nutation precession angles as the
   maximum number of trigonometric terms in the expressions for prime
   meridian location or right ascension or declination of the pole of any
   satellite in the system. This is because the nutation precession angles
   are defined by linear polynomials; each polynomial has two defining
   coefficients.

   The third integer component of the descriptor---the code for the

   For purposes of determining the segment best suited to fulfill a
   particular request, all segments are treated equally. It is only when
   the data in a segment are to be evaluated that the type of data used to
   represent the data becomes important. Because this step is isolated

   NAIF creates most binary PCKs. Normally, binary PCK files should be
   obtained from NAIF.
<P>
 
   Only very knowledgeable users who need to incorporate new
   planetary/satellite orientation information in binary format should
   consider writing binary PCK files. Users who write binary PCK files must
   have a thorough understanding of the information they wish to place in a
   binary PCK file. They must also master the high level structure of the
   PCK files, and they must be sure to correctly package the data for the
   PCK writing subroutines provided in Mice. We also strongly recommend
   that the writer of a PCK file include descriptive comments in the
   comment area.
<P>
 
   The creation of binary form kernels is expected to occur using a Fortran
   or C based program rather than programmatically. If a user needs a
   custom routine for binary kernel creation, the SPICELIB and CSPICE
   Toolkits contain all needed APIs. The Mice Toolkit is based on CSPICE
   and so includes all CSPICE APIs.
<P>
 
   Also note most binary PCK APIs in C lack CSPICE wrappers and so C based
   code will need to call to f2c'd version of the corresponding SPICELIB
   routines.

   Because loading PCK files is usually time-consuming, it is good
   programming practice to have applications load PCK files during program
   initialization rather than throughout their main processing thread,
   especially if that processing thread is a loop.
<P>
 
   It is also wise to avoid designing data processing systems that
   effectively place PCK loading in a tight loop by requiring repeated runs
   of programs that expend a significant fraction of their run time on
   loading PCK files. If a program loads PCK files, it is preferable that
   it do all of its processing in a single run, or at least in a small
   number of runs, rather than carry out its processing by being re-run a
   large number of times: the former design will greatly reduce the ratio
   of the time the program spends loading PCKs to the time it spends on the
   rest of its data processing.

<H3> Loading Text PCK Kernels
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   As earlier mentioned, in order to use text PCK files in an application,
   the data in the files must be read into memory. This is accomplished by
   calling the Mice routine <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. The name of the text PCK file to
   load is supplied as an input to <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>, for example:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>( 'example_pck.tcp' )
</PRE>
   File names supplied to <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> will generally be system-dependent.
   It is good programming practice to not use hard-coded file names in
   calls to <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. Instead, applications should obtain kernel file
   names by one of the following methods:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Reading the kernel file names from a meta-kernel, a file containing the
names. (This allows users to change the kernel files without re-compiling
and re-linking the application.)
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Prompting the user for the file names at run-time.
<BR><BR></UL>
   An application can load any number of text PCK files during a single
   program run. There are, however, parameterized limits on both the total
   number of kernel variables that can be stored and on the total number of
   data values assigned to those variables.
<P>
 
   Each time a text PCK is loaded, the assignments made in the file are
   maintained in the PCK software. In particular, if a kernel variable
   occurs in multiple PCKs loaded in a single run of a program, the value
   of the variable will be the one assigned in the following priority: last
   binary PCK file loaded, previously loaded binary PCK files, then last
   loaded text PCK files followed by previously loaded text PCK files. All
   binary PCK files take precedence over text PCK files. Within the binary
   and/or text file groups, the last loaded files takes precedence.

   Once an PCK file has been loaded, it may be accessed by the PCK

<P>
 
   A PCK file may contain any number of segments. In fact, the same file
   may contain overlapping segments: segments containing data for the same
   body over a common interval. When this happens, the latest segment in a
   file supersedes any competing segments earlier in the file. Similarly,
   the latest file loaded supersedes any earlier files. In effect, several

   The fundamental quantities defined by PCK orientation models are
   actually Euler angles, not matrices. These Euler angles, which we call
   ``RA, DEC, and W,'' are related to the transformation operator returned
   from <a href="../mice/cspice_pxform.html">cspice_pxform</a> by the equation

   Mice provides a routine analogous to <a href="../mice/cspice_pxform.html">cspice_pxform</a> that returns the
   matrix to transform state vectors between reference frames for a
   particular time. This routine is called <a href="../mice/cspice_sxform.html">cspice_sxform</a>; the calling
   sequence being
<P>
 
<PRE>
   rotate = <a href="../mice/cspice_sxform.html">cspice_sxform</a>( from, to, et )
</PRE>
   The input arguments ``from'', ``to'', and ``et'' have the same meanings
   as in the argument list of <a href="../mice/cspice_pxform.html">cspice_pxform</a>. The output argument ``rotate''
   is the 6x6 matrix required to transform state vectors from inertial to
   body-fixed coordinates. Left multiplication of a state vector by
   ``rotate'' will transform it from the frame specified by ``from'' to the
   frame specified by ``to'' at time ``et''.

   WARNING: These low-level access routines for text PCK files only search
   the text kernel pool for these values. Values found in loaded binary PCK
   files will NOT be found by these routines. The values retrieved from a

   kernels. Therefore, if binary kernels have been loaded, values returned
   by these low level routines may not be the same values used by higher
   level routines like <a href="../mice/cspice_sxform.html">cspice_sxform</a> and <a href="../mice/cspice_pxform.html">cspice_pxform</a>. We recommend the

<H1> Appendix B --- Epoch and Frame Specifications in Text PCK Kernels
</H1><HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE><P><BR><BR><BR>
   The constants used in PCK files to define an orientation model for a
   specified body are assumed by default to define a time-dependent
   rotation R(t) that converts vectors from J2000 coordinates to
   body-fixed, planetocentric coordinates at the epoch t seconds past
   J2000, TDB (JED 2451545.0). We say that the constants are ``referenced
   to the J2000 epoch and J2000 frame.'' However, these default values for
   the epoch and frame of the constants may be overridden: it is possible
   to use constants referenced to the B1950 frame and to the J1950 epoch,
   for example.
<P>
 
   The default constants and frame for a body are overridden by setting the
   values of the kernel variables
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY&lt;id code&gt;_CONSTANTS_REF_FRAME
</PRE>
   and
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY&lt;id code&gt;_CONSTANTS_JED_EPOCH
</PRE>
   Here
<P>
 
<PRE>
   &lt;id code&gt;
</PRE>
   is:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> for planets and their satellites: the NAIF integer code of the
corresponding planetary system's barycenter.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> for other bodies: the NAIF integer code of the body itself.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The values of the frame specifier variable
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY&lt;id code&gt;_CONSTANTS_REF_FRAME
</PRE>
   are the frames IDs for the inertial reference frames coded into the
   Frames subsystem. Refer to the Frames Required Reading document,
   <a href="../req/frames.html"><a href="../req/frames.html">frames.req</a></a>, for a list of the inertial reference frames and the
   corresponding frame IDs.
<P>
 
   For example, to use constants referenced to the FK4 frame (frame ID 3)
   for the asteroid Gaspra (ID code = 9511010), the PCK file containing the
   constants should include the assignment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY9511010_CONSTANTS_REF_FRAME   =   (  3  )
</PRE>
   The values of the epoch specifier variable
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY&lt;id code&gt;_CONSTANTS_JED_EPOCH
</PRE>
   are Julian ephemeris dates. To use constants for Gaspra referenced to
   the J1950 epoch, the PCK file containing the constants should include
   the assignment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY9511010_CONSTANTS_JED_EPOCH   =   (  2433282.5 )
</PRE>
   The creator of a PCK file can set the frame and epoch of the constants
   on a body-by-body basis, except in the case of planets and their
   (natural) satellites, where a single choice of frame and epoch must be
   used for each planetary system. For example, to use constants referenced
   to the B1950 frame (frame ID 2) and J1950 epoch for the Earth and Moon,
   use the assignments
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY3_CONSTANTS_REF_FRAME   =   (  2           )
   BODY3_CONSTANTS_JED_EPOCH   =   (  2433282.5 )
</PRE>
   The ID code `3' designates the Earth-Moon barycenter.
<P>
 
   Note: the assignment
<P>
 
<PRE>
   BODY399_CONSTANTS_REF_FRAME   =   (  2           )
   BODY399_CONSTANTS_JED_EPOCH   =   (  2433282.5 )
</PRE>
   would be ignored by the PCK reader routines; you cannot assign a frame
   or epoch using the ID code of a planet or satellite.

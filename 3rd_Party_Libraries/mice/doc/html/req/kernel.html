   Files containing the data used by SPICE are known as kernels (sometimes
   called ``kernel files''). Two kernel architectures exist, referred to as
   text kernels and binary kernels. Text kernels consist of human readable
   ASCII text; binary kernels consist of mostly non-ASCII data.
<P>
 
   Within each architecture there are several kernel types.

<H3> Text Kernels and the Kernel Pool
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Text kernels are used where the amount of data being stored is
   relatively small, and where easy human readability and revision are
   important.
<P>
 
   Text kernels should contain descriptive information, provided by the
   kernel producer, describing the sources and intended uses of the kernel
   data.
<P>
 
   Text kernels associate values with variables using a ``name = value(s)''
   form of assignment. The kernel pool is the repository of the information
   provided in these assignments. Populating the kernel pool occurs in
   either or both of two ways: by loading text kernels -- by far the most
   used method -- or by using pool subsystem functions.
<P>
 
   Once ``name = value(s)'' assignments provided in a text kernel have been
   loaded into the kernel pool the value(s) are said to be associated with
   the names. You may access these data through kernel pool look-up
   functions using the names as keys to find the associated values. The
   kernel pool look-up functions are described in detail a bit later in
   this document. However, some higher-level and more often used functions
   also access data loaded into the kernel pool. Two tables in the tutorial
   named ``Summary of Key Points'' provide details.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Binary Kernels
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Binary kernels store large data sets of primarily non-ASCII data, using
   either the DAF or DAS format (see the technical reference documents
   <a href="../req/daf.html">daf.req</a> and <a href="../req/das.html"><a href="../req/das.html">das.req</a></a> for details). For all but EK binary kernels, loading
   the binary kernel does not cause the subsystem associated with the
   kernel's type to read the principal kernel data; rather only a small
   amount of descriptive data are read so the subsystem becomes aware of
   the existence of the kernel and the nature of the data contained
   therein. The subsystem physically reads primary binary kernel data only
   when a data request is made by a kernel reader function.
<P>
 
   For EK binary kernels, the descriptive data mentioned above, and some
   database schema information, are read in at kernel load time. Principal
   data are read only when an EK query is made by a kernel reader function.
<P>
 
   Data from binary kernels do NOT get placed in the kernel pool; the pool
   is used only for text kernel data.
<P>
 
   Binary kernels contain a ``comment area'' where important descriptive
   information in ASCII form should be provided by the kernel producer.
<P>
 
   On occasion one may be given, or need to make, a ``transfer format''
   file. This is an ASCII-format representation of a binary kernel, used in
   early versions of Mice to port binary kernels between dissimilar
   computers (e.g. IEEE - Little endian to IEEE - Big endian, or
   vice-versa). For the most part these transfer format files are no longer
   needed due to the addition of run-time translation capabilities in the
   binary kernel readers. But there are some situations when transfer
   format binary kernels are still needed; refer to the tutorial named
   ``Porting Kernels'' for details.

<H3> SPICE Kernel Type Identification
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Most SPICE users don't need to know about kernel type identification,
   but since this aspect of kernels is used later on in this document we
   have to explain the concept here.
<P>
 
   The first 6 to 8 bytes of a SPICE kernel are used for file type
   identification. In binary and text kernels this identifier consists of
   two string IDs separated by the ``/'' character. The first ID,
   identifying the file architecture of the kernel file (``DAF'', ``DAS'',
   ``KPL''), is always three characters long. The second ID, identifying
   the file type of the kernel file (``SPK'', ``PCK'', ``IK'', ``SCLK'',
   etc.), is two to four characters long.
<P>
 
   In transfer format files this file type identifier consists of a single
   string ID. See the Convert User's Guide for details.
<P>
 
   In binary kernels the kernel type identifier always occupies the first
   eight bytes. If the combined length of the kernel architecture ID, the
   ``/'' character, and the kernel type ID is less than 8 characters, the
   identifier is padded on the right to eight characters using blanks (e.g.
   ``DAF/SPK '', ``DAS/EK ''). The correct identifier is written to a
   binary kernel automatically when the kernel is created by calling the
   kernel type specific ``open new file'' function -- <a href="../mice/cspice_spkopn.html">cspice_spkopn</a> for SPK
   files, <a href="../mice/cspice_ckopn.html">cspice_ckopn</a> for CK files, etc. If a binary kernel is created by
   calling an architecture specific ``open new file'' function --
   cspice_dafonw for DAF files, cspice_dasonw for DAS files, etc., -- it is
   the caller's responsibility to specify the correct kernel type in the
   corresponding input argument of these functions to make sure the correct
   kernel type identifier is written into the kernel.
<P>
 
   In text kernels the kernel type identifier occupies the first six to
   eight characters and is followed by optional trailing blanks and then by
   the end-of-line terminator character(s), resulting in the identifier
   appearing on a line by itself. If the combined length of the kernel
   architecture ID, the ``/'' character, and the kernel type ID is less
   than 8 characters, the identifier can, but does not have to be padded on
   the right to eight characters using blanks (e.g. ``KPL/SCLK'', ``KPL/IK
   '', etc.). Since most text kernels are created manually using a text
   editor, it is the responsibility of the person making the kernel to put
   the correct identifier by itself on the first line of the kernel.
<P>
 
   In transfer format files the SPICE kernel type identifier occupies the
   first six characters of the file and is followed by the expanded name of
   the format (e.g. ``DAFETF NAIF DAF ENCODED TRANSFER FILE''). The correct
   kernel type identifier is written to a transfer format file
   automatically when the file is created by the SPICE utility programs
   TOXFR or SPACIT. See their user guides, <a href="../ug/toxfr.html">toxfr.ug</a> and <a href="../ug/spacit.html"><a href="../ug/spacit.html">spacit.ug</a></a>, for
   details.
<P>
 
   The SPICE kernel type identifiers used in modern SPICE kernels are as
   follows.
<P>
 
<PRE>
         Binary Kernels:
 
            SPK           DAF/SPK
            CK            DAF/CK
            PCK           DAF/PCK
            EK            DAS/EK
 
         Text Kernels:
 
            FK            KPL/FK
            IK            KPL/IK
            LSK           KPL/LSK
            MK            KPL/MK
            PCK           KPL/PCK
            SCLK          KPL/SCLK
 
         Transfer format files:
 
            DAF           DAFETF
            DAS           DASETF
 
 
</PRE>
   Some older kernels used an earlier version of the kernel type
   identifier. In these kernels one would find:

<PRE>
           NAIF/DAF
           NAIF/DAS
</PRE>
   The Toolkit includes the cspice_getfat function to retrieve the kernel
   file architecture and kernel type encapsulated in the SPICE kernel type
   identifier.
<P>
 
   A text kernel not having a kernel type identifier can, in fact, be
   processed by high-level functions, and by low-level functions other than
   cspice_getfat that use text kernel data. However, NAIF strongly
   recommends kernel creators to provide the identifier.

<H3> Recommendations on Kernel File Naming
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Mice places a few restrictions on kernel file names beyond those imposed
   by your operating system:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Kernel file names, including path specifications, must not exceed 255
characters.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Use of embedded blanks in kernel file names is not supported by Mice. Such
names generally will not be recognized when passed as command-line
arguments to Mice utility programs.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Host system ``shell variables'' or ``environment variables'' cannot be
passed as input arguments to Mice functions.
<BR><BR></UL>
   Mission operations teams often include a variety of identifying and user
   information in kernel names, making them quite long. This practice is
   probably unavoidable, but kernel producers should be aware that when the
   mission's SPICE archive is prepared for delivery to the Planetary Data
   System (PDS), all kernels to be archived must have names consistent with
   PDS standards, including a limitation to a ``36.3'' format (1 to 36
   alphanumeric characters, followed by the decimal character, followed by
   1 to 3 alphanumeric characters) and using only letters, digits and the
   underscore character.
<P>
 
   NAIF recommends kernel names use only lower case letters. NAIF further
   recommends one follows the conventions established for kernel name
   extensions, shown below.

   Other than the general specifications and recommendations in the section
   ``Kernel type identification and kernel naming'' that are applicable to
   binary kernels, specifications for the various binary kernels are

   The specifications and restrictions discussed below apply to any text
   kernel. However, the special type of text kernel known as a meta-kernel
   (sometimes called a ``FURNSH kernel'') has additional restrictions;
   these are discussed later in a section on meta-kernels.

</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Often the easiest and best way to create a text kernel is to start with
   an existing text kernel, editing it to meet your needs. But knowing text
   kernel rules is still important. Those rules are documented in the
   remainder of this section.
<P>
 
   As the name implies, SPICE text kernels contain printable ASCII text
   (ASCII code 32-126). Text kernels may not contain non-printing
   characters, excepting tab (ASCII code 9). However NAIF recommends
   against use of tabs in text kernels. NAIF also recommends caution be
   exercised when cutting/pasting text from a formatted document into a
   text kernel; the text characters displayed in a document may not be in
   the accepted ASCII range, in which case the text kernel parser will fail
   when reading those characters.
<P>
 
   Assignments in SPICE text kernels have a ``name = value(s)'' or ``name
   += value(s)'' format. We illustrate this format by way of an example
   using an excerpt from a SPICE text planetary constants kernel (PCK). The
   format description given below applies to all SPICE text kernels; the
   specific data names shown in this example apply only to text PCK
   kernels.
<P>
 
   The example begins with a SPICE kernel type identifier and is then
   filled out with a combination of descriptive information, called comment
   blocks, and data blocks.

   Numeric values may be provided in integer or floating point

</PRE>
   String values are supplied by quoting the string using a single quote at
   each end of the string, for example
<P>
 
<PRE>
         DISTANCE_UNITS = ( 'KILOMETERS' )
</PRE>
   This quoting convention is independent of the Mice Toolkit language
   version being used.
<P>
 
   All string values, whether part of a scalar or vector assignment, must
   not exceed 80 characters on a given line. Creating a string value longer
   than 80 characters is possible through continuation of an assignment
   over multiple lines; this is described later.
<P>
 
   There is no practical limit on the length of a string value other than
   as mentioned in the section on String Continuation below.
<P>
 
   If you need to include a single quote in the string value, use the
   FORTRAN convention of ``doubling'' the quote.
<P>
 
<PRE>
         MESSAGE = ( 'You can''t always get what you want.' )
</PRE>
   Date values may be entered in a wide variety of formats, using two
   methods. The easiest method is to enter a date as a string, as described
   above. There are no restrictions on the format of a date string entered
   as a string, but if you wish to later use that date string in SPICE
   software the string must conform to SPICE date/time formation rules (see
   the ``Time Required Reading'' document for details).
<P>
 
   A second method for entering dates, unique to text kernels, uses an
   ``@'' syntax. Some examples:
<P>
 
<PRE>
         CALIBRATION_DATES = ( @31-JAN-1987,
                               @feb/4/1987,
                               @March-7-1987-3:10:39.221 )
</PRE>
   Dates entered using the ``@'' syntax may not contain embedded blanks.
<P>
 
   Dates entered using the ``@'' syntax are converted to double precision
   seconds past the reference epoch J2000 as they are read into the kernel
   pool.
<P>
 
   Note that NO time system specification (e.g. UTC or TDB) is implied by
   dates using the ``@'' syntax. Association of a time system with such
   dates is performed by the software that uses them. For example, in SPICE
   leapseconds kernels, such dates represent UTC times; in frames kernels,
   they represent TDB times. You should refer to software user's guides or
   API documentation to understand the interpretation of these dates for
   your application.
<P>
 
   Vector values, whether of numeric, string or date types, are enclosed in
   parenthesis, and adjacent components are separated by either white space
   (blank or carriage return, but not TAB) or commas.
<P>
 
<PRE>
         MISSION_UNITS = ( 'KILOMETERS','SECONDS'
                           'KILOMETERS/SECOND' )
</PRE>
   The types of values assigned to a given kernel pool variable must all be
   the same. If you attempt to make an assignment such as the one shown
   here:
<P>
 
<PRE>
         ERROR_EXAMPLE = ( 1, 2, 'THREE', 4, 'FIVE' )
 
 
</PRE>
   the kernel pool reader will regard the assignment as erroneous and
   reject it.

   Line Length
<P>
 
   All assignments, or portions of an assignment, occurring on a line must
   not exceed 132 characters, including the assignment operator and any
   leading or embedded white space.
<P>
 
   String Continuation
<P>
 
   It is possible to treat specified, consecutive elements of a string
   array as a single ``continued'' string. String continuation is indicated
   by placing a user-specified sequence of non-blank characters at the end
   (excluding trailing blanks) of each string value that is to be
   concatenated to its successor. The string continuation marker can be any
   positive number of printing characters that fit in a string value
   (except not true for meta-kernels).
<P>
 
   For example, if the character sequence
<P>
 
<PRE>
         //
</PRE>
   is used as the continuation marker, the assignment
<P>
 
<PRE>
         CONTINUED_STRINGS = ( 'This //  ',
                               'is //  ',
                               'just //',
                               'one long //',
                               'string.',
                               'Here''s a second //',
                               'continued //'
                               'string.'              )
</PRE>
   allows the string array elements on the right hand side of the
   assignment to be treated as the two strings
<P>
 
<PRE>
         This is just one long string.
         Here's a second continued string.
</PRE>
   Everything between the single quotes, including white space and the
   continuation marker, counts towards the limit of 80 characters in the
   length of each string element.
<P>
 
   The Mice function <a href="../mice/cspice_stpool.html">cspice_stpool</a>, and ONLY that function, provides the
   capability of retrieving continued strings from the kernel pool. See the
   discussion below under ``Fetching Data from the Kernel Pool'' or the

<H3> Loading Kernels
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   For the SPICE system to use kernels, they must be made known to the
   system and opened at run time. This activity is called ``loading''
   kernels. SPICE provides a simple interface for this purpose.
<P>
 
   The principal kernel loading function is named <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> (pronounced
   ``furnish''). A kernel database stores the existence information for any
   kernel (text or binary) loaded by <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. The subsystem provides
   a set of functions that enable an application to find the names and
   attributes of kernels stored in the database.
<P>
 
   Early versions of Mice loaded kernels using functions specific to each
   kernel type. Code written for the binary kernels also supported a kernel
   unload facility. Mice continues to support the original kernel loaders
   and unloaders, but anyone writing new code should use the <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>
   function instead of the kernel-specific functions.
<P>
 
   NAIF recommends loading multiple kernels using a ``meta-kernel'' rather
   than by executing multiple calls to <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. (``Meta-kernels'' are
   sometimes called ``furnsh kernels.'') A meta-kernel is a SPICE text
   kernel that lists the names of the kernels to load. At run time, the
   user's application supplies the name of the meta-kernel as an input
   argument to <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. For example, instead of loading kernels using
   the code fragment:

<H3> Kernel Priority
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   It is fairly common that two kernels of the same type - for example two
   SPKs - to have ``competing data.'' ``Competing'' means that both kernels
   could provide an answer to the user's request for data, even though the
   numeric results would likely be different. This usually occurs when the
   two kernels were produced using different input data and mostly contain
   non-competing data, but do have some overlap in time. When two or more
   kernels contain competing data a kernel loaded later has higher priority
   than kernel(s) loaded earlier. This is true whether using separate calls
   to <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> for each kernel to be loaded, or a single call to
   <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> with a list of kernels to be loaded, or a call to
   <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> that loads a meta-kernel. See Appendix A for a more
   complete discussion on competing data.

<H3> Path Symbols in Meta-kernels
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Inside a meta-kernel it is sometimes necessary to qualify kernel names
   with their path names. To reduce both typing and the need to continue
   kernel names over multiple lines, meta-kernels allow users to define
   symbols for paths. This is done using two kernel variables:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   PATH_VALUES
   PATH_SYMBOLS
</PRE>
   To create symbols for path names, one assigns an array of path names to
   the variable PATH_VALUES. Next, one assigns an array of corresponding
   symbol names to the variable PATH_SYMBOLS. The nth symbol in the second
   array represents the nth path name in the first array.
<P>
 
   Then you can prefix with path symbols the kernel names specified in the
   KERNELS_TO_LOAD variable. Each symbol is prefixed with a dollar sign to
   indicate that it is in fact a symbol.
<P>
 
   Suppose in our example above the MGS kernels reside in the path
<P>
 
<PRE>
   /flight_projects/mgs/SPICE_kernels
</PRE>
   and the other kernels reside in the path
<P>
 
<PRE>
   /generic/SPICE_kernels
</PRE>
   Then we can add paths to our meta-kernel as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   \begindata
 
   PATH_VALUES  = ( '/flight_projects/mgs/SPICE_kernels',
                    '/generic/SPICE_kernels'              )
 
   PATH_SYMBOLS = ( 'MGS',
                    'GEN' )
 
 
   KERNELS_TO_LOAD = ( '$GEN/leapseconds.tls',
                       '$MGS/mgs.tsc',
                       '$GEN/generic.bsp',
                       '$MGS/mgs.bc',
                       '$GEN/earth.bpc',
                       '$MGS/mgs.bes'           )
 
   \begintext
</PRE>
   It is not required that paths be abbreviated using path symbols; it's
   simply a convenience available to you.
<P>
 
   Caution: the symbols defined using PATH_SYMBOLS are not related to the
   symbols supported by a host shell or any other operating system
   interface.

   The KEEPER subsystem maintains a database of the load operations that
   <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> has performed during a program run. This is implemented
   using data structures of fixed size, so there is a limit on the maximum
   number of loaded kernels that the KEEPER subsystem can accommodate.
<P>
 
   When a kernel is loaded using <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>, a new entry is created in
   the database of loaded kernels, whether or not the kernel is already
   loaded.
<P>
 
   All load and unload operations (see the discussion of <a href="../mice/cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a>

   Reloading an already loaded kernel creates another (duplicate) entry in

   The recommended method of increasing the priority of a loaded binary

   using <a href="../mice/cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> (see below), then reload it using <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>.

</H3><P><BR><BR>
   <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> can currently keep track of up to 5000 kernels. The list
   of loaded kernels may contain multiple entries for a given kernel, so
   the number of distinct loaded kernels would be smaller if some have been
   reloaded. Unloading kernels using <a href="../mice/cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> frees room in the kernel
   list, so there is no limit on the total number of load and corresponding
   unload operations performed in a program run.
<P>
 
   The DAF/DAS handle manager system imposes its own limit on the number of
   DAF binary kernels that may be loaded simultaneously. This limit is
   currently set to a total of 5000 DAF kernels.

<H3> Finding Out What's Loaded
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Mice-based applications may need to determine at run time which files
   have been loaded. Applications may need to find the DAF or DAS handles
   of loaded binary kernels so that the kernels may be searched. Some
   applications may need to unload kernels to make room for others, or
   change the priority of loaded kernels at run time.
<P>
 
   Mice provides kernel access functions to support these needs. For every
   loaded kernel, an application can find the name of the kernel, the
   kernel type (text or one of SPK, CK, PCK, or EK), the kernel's DAF or
   DAS handle if applicable, and the name of the meta-kernel used to load
   the kernel, if applicable.
<P>
 
   The function <a href="../mice/cspice_ktotal.html">cspice_ktotal</a> returns the count of loaded kernels of a
   given type. The function <a href="../mice/cspice_kdata.html">cspice_kdata</a> returns information on the nth
   kernel of a given type. The two functions are normally used together.
   The following example shows how an application could retrieve summary
   information on the currently loaded SPK files:
<P>
 
<PRE>
 
 
 
      count = <a href="../mice/cspice_ktotal.html">cspice_ktotal</a>( 'spk' );
 
      if ( count == 0 )
 
         fprintf( 'There are no SPK files loaded at this time.\n' );
 
      else
 
         fprintf( 'The loaded SPK files are: \n' );
 
         for which=1:count
 
            [ file, filtyp, source, handle, found ] = ...
                                        <a href="../mice/cspice_kdata.html">cspice_kdata</a>( which, 'spk');
            fprintf( '%s\n', file );
 
         end
 
      end
</PRE>
   Above, the input argument
<P>
 
   'SPK'
<P>
 
   is a kernel type specifier. The allowed set of values is shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
            SPK  --- Only SPK kernels are counted in the total
            CK   --- Only CK kernels are counted in the total
            PCK  --- Only binary PCK kernels are counted in the
                     total
            EK   --- Only EK kernels are counted in the total
            TEXT --- Only text kernels that are not meta-
                     kernels are included in the total
            META --- Only meta-kernels are counted in the
                     total
            ALL  --- Every type of kernel is counted in the
                     total
</PRE>
   In this example, `filtyp' is a string indicating the type of kernel.
   `handle' is the file handle if the file is a binary SPICE kernel.
   `source' is the name of the meta-kernel used to load the kernel, if
   applicable. `found' indicates whether a kernel having the specified type
   and index was found.

   The function <a href="../mice/cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> acts as an inverse to <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>: passing
   a kernel name to <a href="../mice/cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> undoes the effect of the previous load
   operation performed on that kernel using <a href="../mice/cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. For binary
   kernels that have been loaded just once, the meaning of this is simple:
   the kernel is closed and the database referring to the file is adjusted
   to reflect the absence of the kernel.
<P>
 
   Text kernels are unloaded by clearing the kernel pool and then reloading
   the other text kernels not designated for removal.
<P>
 
   Note that unloading text kernels has the side effect of wiping out any
   kernel variables and associated values that had been entered in the
   kernel pool using any of the kernel pool assignment functions, such as
   <a href="../mice/cspice_pcpool.html">cspice_pcpool</a>. It is important to consider whether this side effect is

   For binary kernels, the conditions resulting in competing data depend on
   the kernel type.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="SPKs"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> SPKs
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   For SPKs, a segment contains data of a single SPK type, providing
   ephemeris for a single target measured relative to a single center and
   given in a single reference frame, spanning between specified start and
   stop times. If ephemeris data from any two segments, whether found in a
   single SPK file or in two SPK files, are for the same target and have an
   overlap in the time spans covered, then the two kernels are said to have
   some competing data. Note that centers play no role in the competition:
   two segments with the same target and different centers may compete.
<P>
 
   By definition, SPKs contain continuous data during the time interval
   covered by a segment, so there is no chance for a ``data gap'' in a
   segment within a higher priority file (later loaded file) leading to a
   state lookup coming from a segment in a lower priority file.
<P>
 
   SPK segment chaining may lead to a problem. It may happen that you have
   loaded into your program sufficient SPK data to compute the desired
   state or position vector, but Mice nevertheless returns an error message
   saying insufficient ephemeris data have been loaded. This can occur if a
   higher priority SPK segment, for which there are not sufficient
   additional SPK data to fully construct your requested state or position
   vector, is masking (blocking) a segment that is part of a viable
   (complete) chain. See the BACKUP section of the SPK tutorial for further
   discussion about this.
<P>
 
   Having competition between two SPKs can be a relatively common
   occurrence when using mission operations kernels, but is far less likely
   when using PDS-archived SPICE data sets because of the clean-up and
   consolidation actions usually taken when an archive delivery is
   produced.
<P>

<A NAME="CKs"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> CKs
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   For CKs, a segment contains data of a single CK type providing the
   orientation of a reference frame associated with one object or
   structure, such as a spacecraft or instrument (sometimes called the
   ``to'' reference frame), relative to a second reference frame, generally
   referred to as the base reference frame (sometimes called the ``from''
   reference frame), spanning between specified start and stop times.
<P>
 
   If transformation data from any two segments, whether found in a single
   CK file or in two CK files, are for the same object/structure (are for
   the same ``to'' frame) and have an overlap in the time span covered,
   then the two kernels may have competing data. But read on.
<P>
 
   However, unlike for SPKs, competition between CK files goes beyond
   segment-level considerations. The so-called ``continuous'' CK types
   (Types 2 through 5) do not necessarily provide orientation results for
   any epoch falling within a segment--there may be real data gaps. And the
   now little used Type 1 CK, containing discrete instances of orientation
   data, can be thought of as containing mostly data gaps.
<P>
 
   While some of the Toolkit software used to compute orientation obtained
   from CKs can provide an orientation result within a gap, this is usually
   not the case. See the CK tutorial and the ``CK Required Reading''
   document for discussions on interpolation intervals, tolerance, and how
   the various CK readers work.
<P>
 
   CK segment chaining may lead to a problem. It may happen that you have
   loaded into your program sufficient CK data to compute the desired
   rotation matrix, but Mice nevertheless returns an error message saying
   insufficient data have been loaded. This can occur if a higher priority
   CK segment, for which there are not sufficient additional CK data to
   fully construct your requested rotation matrix, is masking (blocking) a
   segment that is part of a viable (complete) chain.
<P>
 
   Having competition between two CKs can be a relatively common occurrence
   when using mission operations kernels, but is far less likely when using
   PDS-archived SPICE data sets because of the clean-up and consolidation
   actions usually taken when an archive delivery is prepared.

<H3> Binary PCKs
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   For binary PCKs, a segment contains data of a single binary PCK type
   providing orientation of a reference frame associated with a single
   object (a body-fixed frame), relative to a second reference frame, which
   is always an inertial frame, spanning between specified start and stop
   times. If orientation data from any segment in one binary PCK and
   orientation data from any segment in a second binary PCK are for the
   same body-fixed frame and overlap in time, then the two kernels are said
   to have competing data.
<P>
 
   At present binary PCKs produced by NAIF exist only for the earth and the
   moon. Having competition between the latest high precision, short term
   earth orientation binary PCK and the lower precision, long term predict
   earth orientation binary PCK is a clear possibility -- be sure to load
   the long term predict file first to ensure any higher precision files
   also loaded have higher priority.
<P>
 
   Orientation data provided in any loaded binary PCK have priority over
   what would have otherwise been competing data provided in any loaded
   text PCK.

   If a given variable name has two or more assignments, with the final
   assignment made using the ``='' operator, whether within a single loaded
   text kernel, or from multiple loaded text kernels, or achieved using
   Mice functions, the last such assignment supersedes all previous
   occurrences of the assignment. This superseding happens no matter how
   many values are contained in the last assignment. (It's as if all
   previous assignments for the subject name had never occurred.)

   It is generally best to unload a text kernel before loading another one
   containing competing data.

   Within the kernel pool the length of a string value is limited to 80

   A text kernel assignment made using the ``+='' operator. When an

   appends one or more values to the list of values already associated with
   a variable name. Any previous such associations are NOT replaced; rather
   they are supplemented with the new value(s). Incremental assignments may
   be made to variables that didn't previously exist in the kernel pool; in
   such cases incremental assignments are equivalent to direct assignments.

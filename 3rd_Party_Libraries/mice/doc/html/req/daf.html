   This document is intended for users that require detailed knowledge of

   wish to read state vectors and pointing angles from those files will
   normally do so using only subroutines and programs designed specifically
   for those formats. These subroutines are documented in the NAIF <a href="../req/spk.html">spk.req</a>

<H1> Introduction
</H1><HR SIZE=3 NOSHADE><P><BR><BR><BR>
   DAF---which stands for `Double precision Array File'---is a file
   architecture that provides the advantages of arrays and direct access
   files without incurring the disadvantages of either one.
<P>
 
   This architecture is supported by a set of subroutines, part of the NAIF
   Toolkit software library.
<P>
 
   Only the SPICELIB Toolkits include the full set of DAF APIs; Fortran
   serves as the ground state language. The CSPICE, Icy (IDL), and Mice
   (Matlab) Toolkit have a subset of the API set. This document will note
   those routines available only in Fortran SPICELIB and those available in
   the other language distributions.
<P>
 
   A DAF can contain any number of double precision arrays. Each of these
   arrays can contain an arbitrary number of elements. Because DAF files
   are intended to be portable, the DAF design requires that the array
   elements must be `pure' double precision numbers. That is, they may not
   contain equivalenced or encoded integer or character values.
<P>
 
   The DAF architecture assumes one byte size characters, four byte size
   integers, eight byte size double precision. DAFs created using SPICE
   libraries compiled with other size values may work if the relative size
   ratio between the data types remains 1-4-8.
<P>
 
   The DAF subroutines in SPICE support the following operations:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> Create, open, or close a DAF.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> Add a new array to a file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> Locate an array within a file, either by index or by using descriptive
information about the array.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> Access---that is, retrieve or update---any contiguous set of elements in an
array.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> Convert a binary (direct access) DAF to an equivalent SPICE transfer file,
suitable for transfer to an environment using a form of binary
representation different from that of the source CPU.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>6.</TT> Convert a DAF in SPICE transfer format into an equivalent binary file.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The last two functions make DAFs portable to any environment that
   supports ANSI Standard Fortran-77.

<A NAME="The DAF Format Concept"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> The DAF Format Concept
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The DAF architecture design intends each array contained in a particular
   DAF possess a `descriptive summary' of itself. The information making up
   the summary and the organization of the summary should be the same for
   each array in the DAF. The descriptive summary is composed of double
   precision and integer components. The number of double precision
   components, ND, and the number of integer components, NI, making up the
   array summaries, determine a particular format within the DAF
   architecture.
<P>
 
   Values for ND and NI are fixed at the time a DAF is created. Any two
   DAFs that have the same values for ND and NI can be thought of as having
   the same `format'. (This does not guarantee that the arrays in the files
   contain the same kinds of information, only that they could be stored in
   the same file.) The values selected for ND and NI must satisfy the
   following inequalities:
<P>
 
<PRE>
        (NI + 1)                     (Note that this is
   ND + -------- &lt;= 125               integer division.
            2                         That is, (NI + 1)/2
                                      is rounded down to
                                      the nearest integer.)
 
   0 &lt;= ND &lt;= 124
 
   2 &lt;= NI &lt;= 250
</PRE>
   Each array stored in a DAF is `described', in part, by ND double
   precision numbers and NI integer numbers, which are stored separately
   from the array. Most of the details of this `description'---how many
   numbers are needed, and what they contain---are left to the designer of
   a specific DAF format.
<P>
 
   The double precision numbers could include limits (the smallest and
   largest values in an array), a range of epochs throughout which the
   elements may be used, or statistics (the mean, median, and standard
   deviation of the elements).
<P>
 
   The integer numbers could include contextual information (case number,
   identification codes for related objects or arrays) and conditional
   information (flags to indicate whether the array is unsorted, sorted by
   increasing or decreasing magnitude, or marked for deletion). Some
   integer numbers are used to keep track of the location of the array
   within the file.
<P>
 
   Each array in a DAF is is further described by NC characters of
   alphanumeric information. Examples of this alphanumeric information are
   producer names, archive codes, historical information, or anything else
   that is not easily encoded as double precision or integer numbers.
<P>
 
   NC is a function of ND and NI. The relationship between NC and
   user-specified ND and NI was chosen to allowing a reasonable amount of
   space for storing the alphanumeric information for an array. NC is
   defined below:
<P>
 
<PRE>
                      (NI + 1)
   NC  =   8 * ( ND + -------- )     (Note that this is
                          2           integer division.)
</PRE>
   Using an SPK as an example with NI = 6, ND = 2, then NC = 40.
<P>
 
   The double precision and integer numbers that describe each array are
   `packed', or equivalenced, into an auxiliary double precision array
   before they are stored in the file. This auxiliary array is called the
   `summary' of the associated array. The individual (unpacked) numbers are
   called the `components' of the summary.
<P>
 
   (The first ND elements of the summary contain the double precision
   components of the summary. Each of the remaining elements contains a
   pair of integer components. If NI is odd, the final element of the
   summary contains a single integer component.)
<P>
 
   The NC alphanumeric characters that further describe each array are
   stored in a single character string, called the `name' of the array.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Array Addresses"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Array Addresses
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The location of each array in a DAF is defined by a pair of numbers,
   called the `initial address' and `final address' of the array.
<P>
 
   The term `address' refers to a particular way of looking at an array
   file. Every DAF is actually a standard Fortran-77 direct access file,
   with a particular record length. (Every DAF has the same record length.)
   Each record is capable of storing up to 128 double precision numbers.
<P>
 
   It is convenient, however, to think of a DAF as a numbered collection of
   slots named `words'. Each word is large enough to hold one double
   precision number. Words 1 through 128 are located in the first record of
   the file; words 129 through 256 are located in the second record; and so
   on. The number of each word is called the `address' of the word within
   the file.
<P>
 
   Any pair of addresses defines a contiguous set of words, which may fall
   within a single physical record or span a number of records. The
   elements of each array in a DAF are stored in just such a set. The
   address of the first array element is the `initial address' of the
   array. The address of the final array element is the `final address' of
   the array.
<P>
 
   The initial and final addresses of an array are always the values of the
   final two integer components of the summary for the array.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Array Files and Linked Lists"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Array Files and Linked Lists
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   It is a simplification, but a useful one, to say that the arrays in an
   array file form a doubly-linked list. Each new array added to a file is
   placed at the tail of this list.
<P>
 
   Because the list is doubly-linked, the head and tail of the list can be
   located immediately. The arrays can be located by moving a pointer
   through the list, in either direction, one array at a time.
<P>
 
   At any time, the summary and name of the array at which the pointer is
   currently pointing can be retrieved and examined to determine whether
   the array is of interest. If it is, the initial and final addresses (the
   final two integer components of the summary) may be used to
   access---retrieve or update---the entire array, or any contiguous set of
   elements therein.
<P>
 
   For example, if BEGIN and END are the initial and final addresses of an
   array, the first ten elements of the array can be retrieved by asking
   for the elements stored in addresses BEGIN through BEGIN+9. If the array
   contains an odd number of elements, the middle element can be retrieved
   by asking for the element stored in address (BEGIN+END)/2.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Read and Write Access"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Read and Write Access
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Array files may be opened for two kinds of access: read and write. A
   file opened for read access cannot be changed, either by adding a new
   array or by updating an existing one. Unless one of these operations
   must be performed, files should be opened for read access. The
   protection provided to files opened for read access is independent of
   any particular operating system.
<P>
 
   A program may open only one DAF at a time for write access. When a
   program attempts to open a file for write access, an error is signaled
   if another file is already open for write access, or if the file is
   already open for read access. An error is also signaled if a program
   attempts to open a file for read access if the file is already open for
   write access. (Errors are signaled through the standard SPICE error
   handling mechanism.)
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="File Handles"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> File Handles
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   When a file is opened for either kind of access, it is assigned an
   integer `handle'. A mapping between handles and Fortran logical units is
   maintained internally by the DAF subroutines.
<P>
 
   As a means of accessing files, handles have two advantages over logical
   unit numbers.
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> They reduce the possibility that two or more program units of the same
program will interfere with each other when both need to access the same
DAF. When a program opens a DAF for the first time, the file is connected
to a logical unit, and the unit is mapped to a handle. If the program
attempts to open the same file again, the handle is returned immediately,
and a counter is incremented. The file is not disconnected from the logical
unit until it has been closed as many times as it has been opened. (This is
analogous to the creation of multiple links to a single file under the UNIX
operating system.) Any one program unit is prevented from releasing a file
that is still being used by other program units.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> They allow the SPICE subroutines to prevent files opened for read access
from being modified. (Positive handles are assigned to files opened for
read access, negative handles to files opened for write access. Any attempt
to modify a file with a positive handle signals an error.) Note that this
scheme is independent of any file protection provided by the host operating
system.

<A NAME="Structure"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Structure
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Every DAF is a Fortran-77 direct access file, created by the following
   statement (or an equivalent C statement producing the same results):
<P>
 
<PRE>
   OPEN ( UNIT   = unit,
          FILE   = file name,
          ACCESS = 'DIRECT',
          RECL   = record length,
          STATUS = 'NEW'           )
</PRE>
   The DAF will have binary format (big-endian, little endian, etc.) based
   on the architecture of the machine used to create the DAF.
<P>
 
   The record length is processor dependent. The smallest possible value
   should be selected by the user such that each record in the file is
   large enough to contain 128 double precision numbers (1024 bytes) or
   1000 characters, whichever is larger.
<P>
 
   As of this version of the Toolkit, an expectation exists that a
   character has a size of one byte.
<P>
 
   A DAF contains five types of physical records:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> A single `file record'. This contains global information about the file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> An arbitrary number of `reserved records' for use as the comment area. NAIF
recommends against use of the DAF reserved records routines. Rather, use
the DAF comment area routines to store data information, file notes, or
meta data.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> Some number of `summary records'. These contain array summaries and
pointers to other summary records. The number of summary records in a
particular array file is a function of the number of arrays stored in the
file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>4.</TT> Some number of `name records'. These contain array names. An DAF contains
one name record for each summary record.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>5.</TT> An arbitrary number of `element records'. These contain elements of the
arrays stored in the DAF.
<BR><BR></UL>

<A NAME="The File Record"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> The File Record
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The file record is always the first physical record in a DAF. The record
   size is 1024 bytes (for platforms with one byte char size, and four

<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>&#32;&#32;</TT> The 'xxxx' substring is a string of four characters or less indicating the

merely a direct access file with the same record length. When a DAF is
opened, an error signals if this keyword is not present. [Address 0]

<H3> Comment Area
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Any DAF can contain a number of reserved records for use as a comment
   area. The number of records defines the size of the comment area and is
   assigned when creating the DAF. The comment area of an existing DAF may
   be modified either by adding additional text or deleting the area's
   contents.
<P>
 
   The DAF subsystem includes routines to programmatically manipulate
   reserved records. NAIF recommends against use of these routines, rather
   use those routines designed to manipulate the DAF comment area.
<P>
 
   NAIF also provides utilities to manipulate a DAF comment area. Refer to
   the commnt User's Guide (<a href="../ug/commnt.html">commnt.ug</a>) and spacit User's Guide (<a href="../ug/spacit.html">spacit.ug</a>)
   for relevant information.

<A NAME="Summary Records"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Summary Records
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   A summary record contains a maximum of 128 double precision words. The
   first three words of each summary record are reserved for the following
   control information:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>1.</TT> The record number of the next summary record in the file. (Zero if this is
the final summary record.)
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>2.</TT> The record number of the previous summary record in the file. (Zero if this
is the initial summary record.)
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>3.</TT> The number of summaries stored in this record.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The record pointers form the basis of the array list. Each summary
   record is linked to two other summary records, allowing the summaries to
   be retrieved in forward or backward order. (The links between adjacent
   summaries in a summary record are implicit.) The names can be retrieved
   from the corresponding name records. And the locations (initial and
   final addresses) of the arrays themselves are stored in the summaries.
<P>
 
   Although the control items are integer values, they are stored as double
   precision numbers. This allows summary records and element records,
   which contain only double precision numbers, to be buffered using the
   same mechanism.
<P>
 
   The control items are followed immediately by the summaries themselves.
   The number of summaries (NS) that can fit in a single summary record
   depends on the size of a single summary (SS), a function of NI and ND:
<P>
 
<PRE>
                    (NI + 1)
   SS       =  ND + --------         (Note that this is
                        2             integer division.)
 
   SS * NS &lt;=  125
 
   NS      &lt;=  125/SS                (Note that NS must be an
                                      integer greater than or
                                      equal to one.)
</PRE>
   Using an SPK as an example with NI = 6, ND = 2, then SS = 5.
<P>
 
   A summary record can be depicted as written below, where the numbers
   correspond to the number of the double precision word in the record.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |       ...       | 126 | 127 | 128 |
   -------------------------------------------------------------
     ^   ^   ^
   NEXT  |   |
        PREV |
            NSUM
</PRE>
   If SS is the size (in double precision words) of each summary array,
   then the first summary is stored in words 4 through SS+3; the second
   summary is stored in words SS+4 through 2(SS)+3; and so on. For example,
   if SS is equal to 3, 41 (125/3) summaries can fit in the summary record,
   leaving two words empty. In this case the record can be pictorially
   represented as written below, where the label below the record indicates
   the summary number.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | ... | 124 | 125 | 126 | 127 | 128 |

            NSUM                                     are unused.
</PRE>
   Unlike arrays, summaries are never split across physical record
   boundaries, so the end of each summary record may remain unused.
   Whenever the number of summaries stored in the current summary record
   reaches the maximum number that will fit, a new (empty) summary record
   is added to the end of the file.
<P>
 
   It is now clear that the bounds on the values for ND and NI are
   determined by their relation to the number of double precision words
   used for summary information in the summary record. ND and NI must
   satisfy the following inequalities:
<P>
 
<PRE>
        (NI + 1)                     (Note that this is
   ND + -------- &lt;= 125               integer division.)
            2
 
   0 &lt;= ND &lt;= 124
 
   2 &lt;= NI &lt;= 250

<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Name Records"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Name Records
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Each name record contains nothing but array names. A new name record is
   added to the file each time a new summary record is added. The new name
   record is located in the record immediately following the new summary
   record. Because a DAF is written in this manner, the number of summary
   records is equal to the number of name records.
<P>
 
   Each time a new summary is added to a summary record, a new name is
   added to the corresponding name record. Therefore, the number of
   summaries in a summary record is equal to the number of names in the
   corresponding name record.
<P>
 
   If the numbers in the summary record represent double precision words,
   and the numbers in the name record represent characters, the two records
   can be depicted as written below for a DAF whose format is specified by
   ND = 2 and NI = 2.

<A NAME="Element Records"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H3> Element Records
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   Most of the records in any DAF are element records. Element records hold
   the elements of the arrays stored in the file. (The other records are
   used for accounting purposes only.)
<P>
 
   Each element record contains up to 128 double precision numbers. An
   element record is always full (contains 128 numbers) unless it
   immediately precedes a summary record, in which case it may be partially
   filled.
<P>
 
   The elements stored in a particular element record may belong to more
   than one array. However, elements belonging to the same array are stored
   contiguously within the record.
<P>
 
   For example, suppose three arrays exist: A, B, and C. Array A has 10
   elements, array B has 100 elements, and array C has 15 elements. If all
   of the elements are stored in the same element record, it could be
   pictorially represented as written below:
<P>

   A new DAF can be created by supplying the name of the file, the type of

   number of records to be reserved. NI must be greater than or equal to 2.
   (For more information about the bounds on NI and ND see the subsection
   `Summary records'.)

   CALL DAFONW ( FNAME,                   { Open new }

   The internal name of a DAF is a string of up to 60 bytes, which may be
   used to characterize the contents of the file. Its primary value is
   that, being internal to the file, it remains unchanged when the file is
   transferred between environments.
<P>
 
   Any number of records may be reserved at the front of a DAF. By
   definition, the contents of these records are invisible to DAF

<H2> Adding Arrays
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   A new array can be added to an existing DAF by calling four routines:
   DAFPS, DAFBNA, DAFADA, and DAFENA.
<P>
 
   First, the summary is packed by DAFPS, which requires two arrays
   containing the double precision and integer components of the summary.
   It also requires the values of ND and NI for the file.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFPS ( ND, NI, DC, IC, SUM )     { Pack summary }
 
   This routine currently exists only in Fortran SPICELIB.
   \literal
 
   The final two integer components of the summary are
   always used to store the initial and
   final addresses of the array imposing that NI be
   greater than or equal to two. These components are
   filled in after the array has been
   stored: any values for these components
   supplied by the user are ignored.
 
 
   Next, the new array must be initialized by calling
   DAFBNA. DAFBNA requires the handle of the file
   (which must be open for write access),
   the array name, and the array summary.
 
   \literal
   CALL DAFBNA ( HANDLE, SUM, NAME )      { Begin new array }
 
   This routine currently exists only in Fortran SPICELIB.
</PRE>
   The elements of the array are added by DAFADA. The elements may be
   supplied using one call,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFADA ( DATA, N )                { Add data to array }
 
   This routine currently exists only in Fortran SPICELIB.
</PRE>
   or in any number of installments,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   DO WHILE ( MORE )
       ...
      CALL DAFADA ( DATA, N )             { Add data to array }
   END DO
</PRE>
   Once the entire array has been supplied, DAFENA makes the addition
   permanent.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFENA                            { End new array }
 
   This routine currently exists only in Fortran SPICELIB.
</PRE>
   If the process is aborted before DAFENA is called, the summary and name
   are not stored, and the new array does not become a permanent member of
   the file. Space allocated for elements of the array cannot be removed
   from the file; however, it will be overwritten by the elements of the
   next array added to the file.
<P>
 
   One way to abort the addition of an array to a file is to call DAFBNA
   start a new array in the same file, without first ending the current
   array.
<P>
 
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="Adding Arrays to Multiple Array Files"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Adding Arrays to Multiple Array Files
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   It is possible add data to arrays in multiple files in an interleaved
   fashion: addition of data to an array in one file can be interrupted in
   order to add data to an array in another file. To accomplish this, it is
   necessary to tell DAFADA and DAFENA which file to act upon. This file is
   called the `current file'.
<P>
 
   When DAFBNA is used to begin an array, the file specified by the handle
   passed to DAFBNA becomes the current file. Calls to DAFADA or DAFENA
   will add data to or end the last array begun in this file. If DAFBNA is
   called again, this time with a different handle, the file specified by
   that handle becomes current. Files that are not current are not affected
   in any way by beginning, adding data to, or ending arrays in the current
   file.
<P>
 
   In any given file, an array that is in progress---that is, an array
   begun by DAFBNA but not yet ended by DAFENA---is called the `current
   array' for that file. No file can have more than one current array.
<P>
 
   In order to continue or end an array in a file that is no longer
   current, the file in question is selected as the current file by a call
   to DAFCAD:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFCAD ( HANDLE )                { DAF, continue adding data }
 
   This routine currently exists only in Fortran SPICELIB.
</PRE>
   After this call, the file identified by HANDLE will be the current file,
   and calls to DAFADA will add data to the current array in this file. The
   usual sequence of calls has the form:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFCAD ( HANDLE  )               { DAF, continue adding data }
   CALL DAFADA ( DATA, N )               { DAF, add data to array }
</PRE>
   Since DAFENA can be used to end arrays only in the current file, DAFCAD
   is also used to select a file as current so that an array can be ended
   in that file:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFCAD ( HANDLE  )               { DAF, continue adding data }
   CALL DAFENA                           { DAF, end new array }
</PRE>
   Only files that already have an array in progress may be selected as
   current by DAFCAD. An error will be signaled if DAFCAD is used to select
   a DAF that does not have an array in progress.
<P>
 
   The following example illustrates the use of DAFCAD:
<P>
 
   We write data obtained from the routine GET_DATA (which is not a
   SPICELIB routine) into two separate DAFs. The first N/2 elements of the
   array DATA will be written to the first file; the rest of the array will
   be written to the second file.
<P>
 
   Open the DAFs for write access, using either DAFOPW (if the files
   already exist) or DAFONW (if they do not).
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFOPW ( FNAME1, HANDL1 )
   CALL DAFOPW ( FNAME2, HANDL2 )
</PRE>
   Begin the new DAFs by calling DAFBNA.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFBNA ( HANDL1, SUM1, NAME1 )
   CALL DAFBNA ( HANDL2, SUM2, NAME2 )
</PRE>
   Add data to the arrays, using DAFCAD to select the current file and
   DAFADA to add data to the current array in the current file.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL GET_DATA ( DATA, N, FOUND )
 
   DO WHILE ( FOUND )
 
      CALL DAFCAD   ( HANDL1                          )
      CALL DAFADA   ( DATA,               N/2         )
 
      CALL DAFCAD   ( HANDL2                          )
      CALL DAFADA   ( DATA( N/2 + 1 ),    N - N/2     )
 
      CALL GET_DATA ( DATA, N, FOUND )
 
   END DO
</PRE>
   End each array by calling DAFENA, selecting the file in which to end the
   array by calling DAFCAD:
<P>

   CALL DAFCAD ( HANDL1 )
   CALL DAFENA
 
   CALL DAFCAD ( HANDL2 )

   The notions of `current DAF' and `current array' apply to both adding
   data to arrays and to searching DAFs. However, the files and arrays
   regarded as current for the purpose of searching are unrelated to those
   regarded as current for the purpose of adding data.

   Once arrays are written to a DAF, it is conceivable that their order may
   need to be changed. Suppose that the arrays in a DAF are to be ordered
   according to the arithmetic mean of the data they contain. Also suppose
   that the arithmetic mean of data in an array is stored in the second
   double precision component of the summary. After reading each summary
   and creating a vector IORDER with dimension N that specifies the new
   order of the arrays, the subroutine DAFRA can be used to reorder the
   arrays.

   CALL DAFRA ( HANDLE, IORDER, N )       { Reorder arrays }

   The process of locating an array of interest within an array file is
   known as `searching'. The organization of the arrays as a doubly-linked
   list makes it possible to conduct searches in forward or backward order.
<P>
 
   The complete set of DAF routines that act on the current file (for
   searching) is:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   DAFFNA                                 { DAF, find next array }
   DAFFPA                                 { DAF, find previous array }
   DAFGS                                  { DAF, get summary }
   DAFGN                                  { DAF, get name }
   DAFGH                                  { DAF, get handle }
   DAFRS                                  { DAF, replace summary }
   DAFRN                                  { DAF, replace name }
   DAFWS                                  { DAF, write summary }
</PRE>
   Subroutines DAFBFS and DAFFNA are used to search a DAF in forward order.
   DAFBFS places a pointer at the head of the doubly-linked list formed by
   the arrays in the file. Each call to DAFFNA moves the pointer to the
   next array in the list. (The first call to DAFFNA moves the pointer to
   the first array.) DAFFNA returns a logical flag which is true whenever
   another array has been found, and is false when the tail of the list has
   been reached. All forward searches are variations on the following
   template:

   Subroutines DAFBBS and DAFFPA are likewise used to search a DAF in

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Searching Multiple Array Files
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Searching multiple DAFs simultaneously is a little like adding data to
   multiple files simultaneously: in each case, it becomes necessary to
   identify the file to act upon, when calling routines that don't accept
   an input handle argument.
<P>
 
   As with adding data, the notions of `current DAF' and `current array'
   apply to searching. Starting a search in an array file by calling either
   DAFBFS or DAFBBS makes that file the `current file'. Subsequent calls to
   DAFFNA or DAFFPA advance or back up the array pointer in the current
   file. The last array found by DAFFNA or DAFFPA in the `current file' is
   the `current array' for that file. As mentioned above, there is no
   relation between the files or arrays that are considered current for
   searching and those considered current for adding data.
<P>
 
   If, after a search is started in one DAF, DAFBFS or DAFBBS are called to
   start a search in a second DAF, the second file becomes current: DAFFNA,
   DAFFPA, DAFGN, and DAFGS will all operate on the second file.
<P>
 
   The routine DAFCS is used to continue a search in a DAF that is no
   longer current. Calling DAFCS makes the file specified by the input
   handle argument the current file for searching:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFCS  ( HANDLE )                 { DAF, continue search }
</PRE>
   After this call, the routines in the above list will act upon the file
   designated by HANDLE. For example, to continue a forward search in that
   file,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFCS  ( HANDLE )                 { DAF, continue search }
   CALL DAFFNA ( FOUND  )                 { DAF, find next array }
</PRE>
   and to continue a backward search,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFCS  ( HANDLE )                 { DAF, continue search     }
   CALL DAFFPA ( FOUND  )                 { DAF, find previous array }
</PRE>
   while to get the name and summary of the current array in the file,
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFCS ( HANDLE )                  { DAF, continue search }
   CALL DAFGN ( NAME )                    { DAF, get name }
   CALL DAFGS ( SUM  )                    { DAF, get summary }
</PRE>
   A search must have been started by DAFBFS or DAFBBS before it can be
   continued. An error will signal if DAFCS is used to continue a search in
   a DAF in which no search has been started.

<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Accessing Array Elements
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   After an array of interest has been located, the entire array or any
   contiguous set of elements can be accessed---read or updated---by
   supplying a pair of addresses. Elements are read by DAFRDA and written
   by DAFWDA.
<P>
 
   The following code fragment continues the example above by subtracting
   the average from each of the elements in the array. (Recall that IA and
   FA contain the initial and final addresses of the array.)
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFRDA ( HANDLE, IA, FA, DATA )   { Read data
                                            from address }
   DO I = 1, FA - IA + 1
      DATA(I) = DATA(I) - MAXAVG
   END DO
 
   CALL DAFWDA ( HANDLE, IA, FA, DATA )   { Write data
                                            to address }
</PRE>
   Note that it is not necessary to retrieve the entire array at once. The
   following code fragment illustrates how to process an array of unknown
   size using a fixed amount of local storage. The local array DATA is
   declared to be size CHUNK. DAFRDA reads a maximum of CHUNK elements from
   the double precision array and DAFWDA writes them. This technique is
   useful when the arrays stored in a DAF may be arbitrarily large.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   FIRST = IA
 
   DO WHILE ( FIRST .LE. FA )
      LAST  = MIN ( FA,     FIRST + CHUNK - 1 )
      CALL DAFRDA ( HANDLE, FIRST, LAST, DATA )   { Read data
                                                    from address }
      NUMELE = LAST - FIRST + 1
 
      DO I = 1, NUMELE
         DATA(I) = DATA(I) - MAXAVG
      END DO
 
      CALL DAFWDA ( HANDLE, FIRST, LAST, DATA )   { Write data
      FIRST = FIRST + CHUNK                         to address }

   In the previous example, once the average value of the array has been
   subtracted from each element of the array, the value for the average
   stored in the summary is no longer valid (the average is now zero) and
   should be changed.
<P>
 
   Subroutines DAFRS and DAFRN are analogous to subroutines DAFGS and
   DAFGN. DAFGS `gets' the summary for the array to which the pointer
   currently points; DAFRS replaces it. DAFGN `gets' the name of the array
   to which the pointer currently points; DAFRN replaces it.
<P>
 
   If the index, K, of the updated array is known, then the new average for
   the array (zero) is stored by the following code fragment.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFBFS ( HANDLE )                 { Begin forward search }

<A NAME="Buffering"></A>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<H2> Buffering
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   Unless the value of CHUNK is 128 (the number of double precision words
   in a record) and the initial address of the array happens to correspond
   to the first word of a physical record (neither of which is very
   likely), each call to DAFRDA or DAFWDA will involve reading partial
   records---data that spans across records. In general, successive calls
   will refer to different parts of at least one record.
<P>
 
   In fact, as records are read from DAFs they are saved in an internal
   buffer maintained by the DAF subroutines. If any part of a record is
   needed, it can frequently be returned directly from the buffer, without
   accessing the file again. In particular, when an entire array is
   accessed sequentially, as in the example above, each of the necessary
   records is read exactly one time. When the elements of an array are
   accessed more randomly, the number of file accesses may increase
   somewhat.
<P>
 
   It is possible, at any point in a program, to determine the number of
   file accesses prevented by the buffering scheme. The subroutine DAFNRR
   returns the number of physical records actually read, and the number of
   records or partial records that have been requested, as illustrated
   below:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   CALL DAFNRR ( READS, REQS )            { Number of reads,
                                            requests         }
   RATIO  = DBLE(READS) / DBLE(REQS)
   PERCNT = INT ( RATIO * 100.D0 )
   WRITE (*,*) 'Reads/requests (%) = ', PERCNT
</PRE>
   Ideally, the ratio of reads to requests should approach zero. In the
   worst case, where it approaches one, the size of the buffer should
   probably be adjusted. (The module headers for DAFRDR and DAFWDR provide
   details on adjusting the buffer size. Please consult NAIF before
   altering the buffer size.)

<H2> Creating an Array File
</H2><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=50% ><P><BR><BR>
   The following example illustrates the use of addresses and lists within
   an DAF by showing how a simple array file might be created, and how
   arrays might be added to that file.
<P>
 
   Throughout the example, the following notations will be used:
<P>
 
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Within the file record there are several values: IDWORD, ND, NI, RI, RF,
and FFA. IDWORD is a character string that contains the file architecture,
DAF, and code for the type of data stored in the DAF file. This code is a
string consisting of four characters or less and is described in the header
of the routine DAFONW. ND and NI are the values of the parameters that
define the format of the file. RI and RF are the record numbers of the
initial and final summary records in the file. FFA is the first free
address in the file.
<BR><BR></UL>
<UL>
<TT>--</TT> Within a particular summary record, NEXT and PREV are the record numbers of
the next and previous summary records in the file, and NSUM is the number
of summaries stored in the record.
<BR><BR></UL>
   The first step in creating a file is to determine the name to be given
   to the type of data stored in the DAF file. For this example, the data
   type will be 'Xmpl'. For more information about the restrictions on the
   character string describing the type of data in the DAF file, see the
   header of the routine DAFONW. The IDWORD written to the new file is the
   concatenation of the string 'DAF/' with the data type string. So, for
   this example, the IDWORD written to the new file is 'DAF/Xmpl'.
<P>
 
   The next step is to select values for ND and NI. Normally, these are
   relatively small, allowing several summaries to fit in each summary
   record and thus increasing the speed with which the file can be
   searched. A new file is opened by calling DAFONW, specifying the
   selected values for ND and NI. Recall that the final two integer
   components of any array summary---IC(NI-1) and IC(NI)---contain the
   initial and final addresses of the array, so NI must be at least 2.
<P>
 
   The example will be easier to follow, however, if the number of
   summaries that can fit in a summary record is minimized. Therefore, in
   this example ND and NI will take on unusually large values:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   ND = 25
   NI = 27
</PRE>
   Each array summary requires 39 double precision words of storage:
<P>
 
<PRE>
        (NI + 1)
   ND + -------- =  25 + 14 = 39
           2
</PRE>
   Therefore, each summary record can hold 3 summaries:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   125 (words per record)
   -----------------------  =  3 (summaries per record)
    39 (words per summary)
</PRE>
   If `Summary(i)[j]' represents the j'th element of the i'th summary
   array, then the layout of a typical summary record is shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   Word     Value
   ----     ----------------
      1     NEXT
      2     PREV
      3     NSUM
      4     Summary( 1)[ 1]
      5     Summary( 1)[ 2]
             ...
     42     Summary( 1)[39]
     43     Summary( 2)[ 1]
             ...
     81     Summary( 2)[39]
     82     Summary( 3)[ 1]
             ...
    120     Summary( 3)[39]
    121     Unused
             ...
    128     Unused
</PRE>
   The number of names that an array record can hold is equivalent to the
   number of summaries that the summary record can hold. In this example
   it's three.
<P>
 
   Recall that NC, the maximum number of characters in an array name, is
   determined by the values of ND and NI. For this example, where ND = 25
   and NI = 27, the value of NC is computed below:
<P>
 
<PRE>
                      (NI + 1)
   NC  =   8 * ( ND + -------- )  = 8 * ( 25 + 14 ) = 8 * 39 = 312
                          2
</PRE>
   Each array name may use up to 312 characters of storage. An array name
   does not have to be exactly NC characters long. NC is simply the limit
   on the length of the array name.
<P>
 
   If `Name(i)[j]' represents the j'th character of the i'th name, then the
   layout of a typical name record is shown below.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   Character    Value
   ---------    --------------
           1     Name( 1)[  1]
           2     Name( 1)[  2]
                  ...
         312     Name( 1)[312]
         313     Name( 2)[  1]
                  ...
         624     Name( 2)[312]
         625     Name( 3)[  1]
                  ...
         936     Name( 3)[312]
         937     Unused
                  ...
        1000     Unused
</PRE>
   Assume that RESV, the number of reserved records, is 10. When DAFONW
   opens the new file, it stores the file record information in record 1,
   the reserved records in records 2 through 11, and the initial summary
   record in record 12. Because the file is empty, the initial summary
   record, RI, is also the final summary record, RF.
<P>
 
<PRE>
   RI = 12
   RF = 12
</PRE>
   DAFONW stores the lone name record for the file immediately after the
   summary record, in record 13. Therefore the first free address, FFA, in
   the file is the first word in record 14:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   FFA = word + (record - 1) * 128
 
       =    1 + (14     - 1) * 128
 
       =    1 + 1664
 
       =    1665
</PRE>
   DAFONW also writes the internal file name to the file record. For this
   example the internal file name will be 'TESTFILE'. For the rest of the
   example, the file record will be depicted as a collection of values
   enclosed by braces and preceded by a record number:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   r { IDWORD=x, ND=a, NI=b, IFNAME=c, RI=d, RF=e, FFA=f }
</PRE>
   So, the file record for this example file is initially:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   1 { IDWORD='DAF/Xmpl', ND=25, NI=27, IFNAME='TESTFILE',
                          RI=12, RF=12, FFA=1665           }
</PRE>
   Because there is only one summary record, the values of NEXT and PREV in
   that record are both zero. Because the file contains no arrays, the
   value of NSUM is also zero. The information needed to create the summary
   record is complete. For the rest of the example, each summary record
   will be depicted as a collection of values enclosed by angle brackets
   and preceded by a record number:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   r &lt; NEXT=a, PREV=b, NSUM=c, (d,e),(f,g),(h,i) &gt;
</PRE>
   The ordered pairs enclosed in parentheses are the initial and final
   addresses of the arrays whose summaries are contained in the record. The
   remaining components of each summary are ignored in order to make the
   example easier to follow. Thus, the lone summary record for this example
   file is initially:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   12 &lt; NEXT=0, PREV=0, NSUM=0, (0,0),(0,0),(0,0) &gt;
</PRE>
   Name records will always be depicted as
<P>
 
<PRE>
   r &lt; " " &gt;
</PRE>
   Element records will always be depicted as
<P>
 
<PRE>
   r &lt; N &gt;
</PRE>
   where N is the number of elements stored in the record.
<P>
 
   Once the initial summary and name records have been written, the file is
   complete, if uninteresting:
<P>
 
<PRE>
    1 { IDWORD='DAF/Xmpl', ND=25, NI=27, IFNAME='TESTFILE',
                           RI=12, RF=12, FFA=1665           }
    2
    .
    . Records 2 through 11 are reserved records.
    .
   11
   12 &lt; NEXT=0, PREV=0, NSUM=0, (0,0),(0,0),(0,0) &gt;
   13 &lt; " " &gt;
</PRE>
   Assume that an array A1, containing 100 elements, is to be added to the
   file. The array will be stored contiguously, beginning at the first free
   address. Thus, its initial and final addresses will be 1665 (start
   record 14, so 128 * 13 + 1) and 1764 ( 128 * 13 + 100), respectively.
   The entire array fits into a single record, so one element record will
   be added to the file. The value of NSUM in the summary record is
   incremented by one. The new value of FFA is the address following the
   final address of the new array: 1765. This is stored in the file record.
<P>
 
<PRE>
    1 { IDWORD='DAF/Xmpl', ND=25, NI=27, IFNAME='TESTFILE',

</PRE>
   Assume that a second array A2, containing 200 elements, is to be added
   to the file. The elements will be stored between addresses 1765 and
   1964. The array will fill the remainder of the first element record, all
   of a second record, and part of a third, so two element records will be
   added to the file. The value of NSUM in the summary record is
   incremented again. And the new value of FFA (1965) is stored in the file
   record.

   To add a third array A3, containing 150 elements, the process is
   repeated. The elements will be stored between addresses 1965 and 2114.
   The array will fill the remainder of the third element record, and part

   Note that the final summary record is full, so new summary and name

   Adding more arrays is identical to the previous example: the necessary
   element records are added; the summary and name records are updated; and
   the value of FFA is updated. However, every third array also adds new
   summary and name records, and the values of RF and FFA are updated as
   well.

   Many of the subroutines listed here are not normally used except to
   support other subroutines. For example, because the subroutines that
   read and write records (DAFRCR, DAFRDR, DAFRFR, DAFWCR, DAFWDR, DAFWFR)
   are low level routines, they are not usually called by a typical user,
   but instead by higher level DAF routines.

   The document differs from the previous version of September 1991 in that
   it includes the addition of new routines that should be used instead of
   existing SPICELIB routines. DAFONW replaces DAFOPN, DAFTB replaces
   DAFA2B and DAFT2B, and DAFBT replaces DAFB2A and DAFB2T. Also, the term
   to describe the non-binary DAF file, text, has been replaced with a more
   accurate term, transfer, indicating that the files are written in a
   format suitable for transfer from one platform to another.

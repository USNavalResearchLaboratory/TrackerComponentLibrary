   CSPICE_SUBPNT computes the rectangular coordinates of the
   sub-observer point on a target body at a specified epoch,
   optionally corrected for light time and stellar aberration.

   This routine supersedes <a href="cspice_subpt.html">cspice_subpt</a>, which does not have an input
   argument for the target body-fixed frame name.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      method   a scalar string providing parameters defining
               the computation method to be used.

               The supported values of 'method' are listed below.
               Please note that the colon is a required delimiter;
               using a blank will not work.

                     'Near point: ellipsoid'   The sub-observer point
                                               computation uses a
                                               triaxial ellipsoid to
                                               model the surface of the
                                               target body. The
                                               sub-observer point is
                                               defined as the nearest
                                               point on the target
                                               relative to the observer.

                     'Intercept: ellipsoid'    The sub-observer point
                                               computation uses a
                                               triaxial ellipsoid to
                                               model the surface of the
                                               target body. The
                                               sub-observer point is
                                               defined as the target
                                               surface intercept of the
                                               line containing the
                                               observer and the
                                               target's center.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               'method'. For example, the string

                    ' nearpoint:ELLIPSOID '

               is valid.

      target   the scalar string name of the target body. The target
               body is an ephemeris object (its trajectory is given by
               SPK data), and is an extended object.

               The string 'target' is case-insensitive, and leading
               and trailing blanks in 'target' are not significant.
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the
               integer ID code for the object. For example both
               'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
               the moon is the target body.

               When the target body's surface is represented by a
               tri-axial ellipsoid, this routine assumes that a
               kernel variable representing the ellipsoid's radii is
               present in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel
               variable would be defined by loading a PCK file.


      et       the double precision scalar epoch, expressed as seconds
               past J2000 TDB, of the observer: 'et' is
               the epoch at which the observer's state is computed.

               When aberration corrections are not used, 'et' is also
               the epoch at which the position and orientation of
               the target body are computed.

               When aberration corrections are used, 'et' is the epoch
               at which the observer's state relative to the solar
               system barycenter is computed; in this case the
               position and orientation of the target body are
               computed at et-lt or et+lt, where 'lt' is the one-way
               light time between the sub-observer point and the
               observer, and the sign applied to 'lt' depends on the
               selected correction. See the description of 'abcorr'
               below for details.

      fixref   the scalar string name of the body-fixed, body-centered
               reference frame associated with the target body.
               The output sub-observer point 'spoint' will be
               expressed relative to this reference frame.

      abcorr   the scalar string aberration correction to apply
               when computing the observer-target state and the
               orientation of the target body.

               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
               sub-observer point seen by the observer is desired,
               normally either of the corrections

                     'LT+S'
                     'CN+S'

               should be used. These and the other supported options
               are described below. 'abcorr' may be any of the
               following:

                     'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                                geometric sub-observer point on the
                                target body.

               Let 'lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the sub-observer point (note: NOT
               between the observer and the target body's center).
               The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               sub-observer point's location at the light-time
               corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's
               location at 'et':

                     'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                                called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                                Newtonian formulation. This correction
                                yields the location of sub-observer
                                point at the moment it emitted photons
                                arriving at the observer at 'et'.

                                The light time correction uses an
                                iterative solution of the light time
                                equation. The solution invoked by the
                                'LT' option uses one iteration.

                                Both the target position as seen by the
                                observer, and rotation of the target
                                body, are corrected for light time.

                     'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                                stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                                formulation. This option modifies the
                                state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                                account for the observer's velocity
                                relative to the solar system
                                barycenter. The result is the apparent
                                sub-observer point as seen by the
                                observer.

                     'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                                correction. In solving the light time
                                equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                                until the solution converges. Both the
                                position and rotation of the target
                                body are corrected for light time.

                     'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time and
                                stellar aberration corrections. This
                                option produces a solution that is at
                                least as accurate at that obtainable
                                with the 'LT+S' option. Whether the 'CN+S'
                                solution is substantially more accurate
                                depends on the geometry of the
                                participating objects and on the
                                accuracy of the input data. In all
                                cases this routine will execute more
                                slowly when a converged solution is
                                computed.

               The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at 'et' and arrive at the
               sub-observer point at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                     'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                                 one-way light time using a Newtonian
                                 formulation. This correction yields the
                                sub-observer location at the moment it
                                receives photons emitted from the
                                observer's location at 'et'.

                                The light time correction uses an
                                iterative solution of the light time
                                equation. The solution invoked by the
                                'LT' option uses one iteration.

                                Both the target position as seen by the
                                observer, and rotation of the target
                                body, are corrected for light time.

                     'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                                one-way light time and stellar
                                aberration using a Newtonian
                                formulation  This option modifies the
                                sub-observer point obtained with the
                                'XLT' option to account for the
                                observer's velocity relative to the
                                solar system barycenter.

                     'XCN'      Converged Newtonian light time
                                correction. This is the same as XLT
                                correction but with further iterations
                                to a converged Newtonian light time
                                solution.

                     'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                                Newtonian light time and stellar
                                aberration corrections.

      obsrvr   the scalar string name of the observing body. The
               observing body is an ephemeris object: it typically
               is a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point on the
               earth. 'obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and
               'obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               trailing blanks in supply a string containing the integer
               ID code for the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301'
               are legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
               observer.

   the call:

      [spoint, trgepc, srfvec] = <b>cspice_subpnt</b>( method, target, ...
                                                et,     fixref, ...
                                                abcorr, obsrvr)

   returns:

      spoint   a double precision 3x1 array defining the sub-observer point
               on the target body.

               The sub-observer point is defined either as the point
               on the target body that is closest to the observer,
               or the target surface intercept of the line from the
               observer to the target's center; the input argument
               'method' selects the definition to be used.

               'spoint' is expressed in Cartesian coordinates,
               relative to the body-fixed target frame designated by
               'fixref'. The body-fixed target frame is evaluated at
               the sub-observer epoch 'trgepc' (see description below).

               When light time correction is used, the duration of
               light travel between 'spoint' to the observer is
               considered to be the one way light time.

               When aberration corrections are used, 'spoint' is
               computed using target body position and orientation
               that have been adjusted for the corrections
               applicable to 'spoint' itself rather than to the target
               body's center. In particular, if the stellar
               aberration correction applicable to 'spoint' is
               represented by a shift vector 's', then the light-time
               corrected position of the target is shifted by 's'
               before the sub-observer point is computed.

               The components of 'spoint' have units of km.

      trgepc   the scalar double precision &quot;sub-observer point epoch.&quot;
              'trgepc' is defined as follows: letting 'lt' be the one-way
               light time between the observer and the sub-observer point,
               'trgepc' is the epoch et-lt, et+lt, or 'et' depending on
               whether the requested aberration correction is,
               respectively, for received radiation, transmitted
               radiation, or omitted. 'lt' is computed using the
               method indicated by 'abcorr'.

              'trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

      srfvec   a double precision 3x1 array defining the position vector
               from the observer at 'et' to 'spoint'. 'srfvec'
               is expressed in the target body-fixed  reference frame
               designated by 'fixref', evaluated at  'trgepc'.

               The components of 'srfvec' are given in units of km.

               One can use the CSPICE function vnorm_c to obtain the
               distance between the observer and 'spoint':

                  dist = norm( srfvec )

               The observer's position 'obspos', relative to the
               target body's center, where the center's position is
               corrected for aberration effects as indicated by
               'abcorr', can be computed with:

                  obspos = spoint - srfvec

               To transform the vector 'srfvec' from a reference frame
               'fixref' at time 'trgepc' to a time-dependent reference
               frame 'ref' at time 'et', the routine '<a href="cspice_pxfrm2.html">cspice_pxfrm2</a>' should be
               called. Let 'xform' be the 3x3 matrix representing the
               rotation from the reference frame 'fixref' at time
               'trgepc' to the reference frame 'ref' at time 'et'. Then
               'srfvec' can be transformed to the result 'refvec' as
               follows:

                  xform  = <a href="cspice_pxfrm2.html">cspice_pxfrm2</a> ( fixref, ref, trgepc, et )
                  refvec = xform * srfvec

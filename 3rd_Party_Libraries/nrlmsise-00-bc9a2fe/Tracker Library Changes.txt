The function ghp7 has been modified to return the computed altitudes, as
was the case in the original Fortran code.

The code has been modified to use mxMalloc and mxFree, which are preferred
in Matlab over malloc and free. Also, printf statements have been replaced
with the appropriate native. Matlab functions, and some variables were
renamed to get rid of warnings about shadowing global variables.

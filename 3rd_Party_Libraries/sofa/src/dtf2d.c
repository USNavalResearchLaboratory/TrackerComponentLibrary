**
**  Encode date and time fields into 2-part Julian Date (or in the case
**  of UTC a quasi-JD form that includes special provision for leap
**  seconds).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     scale     char[]  time scale ID (Note 1)
**     iy,im,id  int     year, month, day in Gregorian calendar (Note 2)
**     ihr,imn   int     hour, minute
**     sec       double  seconds
**
**  Returned:
**     d1,d2     double  2-part Julian Date (Notes 3,4)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               int     status: +3 = both of next two
**                               +2 = time is after end of day (Note 5)
**                               +1 = dubious year (Note 6)
**                                0 = OK
**                               -1 = bad year
**                               -2 = bad month
**                               -3 = bad day
**                               -4 = bad hour
**                               -5 = bad minute
**                               -6 = bad second (<0)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) scale identifies the time scale.  Only the value "UTC" (in upper
**     case) is significant, and enables handling of leap seconds (see
**     Note 4).
**
**  2) For calendar conventions and limitations, see iauCal2jd.
**
**  3) The sum of the results, d1+d2, is Julian Date, where normally d1
**     is the Julian Day Number and d2 is the fraction of a day.  In the
**     case of UTC, where the use of JD is problematical, special
**     conventions apply:  see the next note.
**
**  4) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The SOFA internal convention is that
**     the quasi-JD day represents UTC days whether the length is 86399,
**     86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era there were
**     smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the linear UTC(TAI)
**     expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps" are also included
**     in the SOFA convention.
**
**  5) The warning status "time is after end of day" usually means that
**     the sec argument is greater than 60.0.  However, in a day ending
**     in a leap second the limit changes to 61.0 (or 59.0 in the case
**     of a negative leap second).
**
**  6) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
**
**  7) Only in the case of continuous and regular time scales (TAI, TT,
**     TCG, TCB and TDB) is the result d1+d2 a Julian Date, strictly
**     speaking.  In the other cases (UT1 and UTC) the result must be
**     used with circumspection;  in particular the difference between
**     two such results cannot be interpreted as a precise time
**     interval.
**
**  Called:
**     iauCal2jd    Gregorian calendar to JD
**     iauDat       delta(AT) = TAI-UTC
**     iauJd2cal    JD to Gregorian calendar

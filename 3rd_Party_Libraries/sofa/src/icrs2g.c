**
**  Transformation from ICRS to Galactic Coordinates.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support routine.
**
**  Given:
**     dr     double      ICRS right ascension (radians)
**     dd     double      ICRS declination (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     dl     double      galactic longitude (radians)
**     db     double      galactic latitude (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The IAU 1958 system of Galactic coordinates was defined with
**     respect to the now obsolete reference system FK4 B1950.0.  When
**     interpreting the system in a modern context, several factors have
**     to be taken into account:
**
**     . The inclusion in FK4 positions of the E-terms of aberration.
**
**     . The distortion of the FK4 proper motion system by differential
**       Galactic rotation.
**
**     . The use of the B1950.0 equinox rather than the now-standard
**       J2000.0.
**
**     . The frame bias between ICRS and the J2000.0 mean place system.
**
**     The Hipparcos Catalogue (Perryman & ESA 1997) provides a rotation
**     matrix that transforms directly between ICRS and Galactic
**     coordinates with the above factors taken into account.  The
**     matrix is derived from three angles, namely the ICRS coordinates
**     of the Galactic pole and the longitude of the ascending node of
**     the galactic equator on the ICRS equator.  They are given in
**     degrees to five decimal places and for canonical purposes are
**     regarded as exact.  In the Hipparcos Catalogue the matrix
**     elements are given to 10 decimal places (about 20 microarcsec).
**     In the present SOFA function the matrix elements have been
**     recomputed from the canonical three angles and are given to 30
**     decimal places.
**
**  2) The inverse transformation is performed by the function iauG2icrs.
**
**  Called:
**     iauAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
**     iauAnpm      normalize angle into range +/- pi
**     iauS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
**     iauRxp       product of r-matrix and p-vector
**     iauC2s       p-vector to spherical

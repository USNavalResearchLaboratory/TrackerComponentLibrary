**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function exists to enable sidereal-tracking applications to
**     avoid wasteful recomputation of the bulk of the astrometry
**     parameters:  only the Earth rotation is updated.
**
**  2) For targets expressed as equinox based positions, such as
**     classical geocentric apparent (RA,Dec), the supplied theta can be
**     Greenwich apparent sidereal time rather than Earth rotation
**     angle.
**
**  3) The function iauAper13 can be used instead of the present
**     function, and starts from UT1 rather than ERA itself.
**
**  4) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**     The various functions support different classes of observer and
**     portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
**     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**     supplied by the caller.
**
**     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.

**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply

**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from

**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.

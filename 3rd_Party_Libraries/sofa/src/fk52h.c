**
**  Transform FK5 (J2000.0) star data into the Hipparcos system.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given (all FK5, equinox J2000.0, epoch J2000.0):
**     r5      double    RA (radians)
**     d5      double    Dec (radians)
**     dr5     double    proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     dd5     double    proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     px5     double    parallax (arcsec)
**     rv5     double    radial velocity (km/s, positive = receding)
**
**  Returned (all Hipparcos, epoch J2000.0):
**     rh      double    RA (radians)
**     dh      double    Dec (radians)
**     drh     double    proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     ddh     double    proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)
**     pxh     double    parallax (arcsec)
**     rvh     double    radial velocity (km/s, positive = receding)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function transforms FK5 star positions and proper motions
**     into the system of the Hipparcos catalog.
**
**  2) The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than
**     cos(Dec)*dRA/dt, and are per year rather than per century.
**
**  3) The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation is modeled as a pure
**     rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalog are not
**     taken into account.
**
**  4) See also iauH2fk5, iauFk5hz, iauHfk5z.

**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it

**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions

**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not

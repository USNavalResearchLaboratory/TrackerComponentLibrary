**
**  Position and velocity of a terrestrial observing station.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     elong   double       longitude (radians, east +ve, Note 1)
**     phi     double       latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 1)
**     hm      double       height above ref. ellipsoid (geodetic, m)
**     xp,yp   double       coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 2)
**     sp      double       the TIO locator s' (radians, Note 2)
**     theta   double       Earth rotation angle (radians, Note 3)
**
**  Returned:
**     pv      double[2][3] position/velocity vector (m, m/s, CIRS)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The terrestrial coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
**     reference ellipsoid.
**
**  2) xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
**     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
**     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator
**     s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
**     Origin on the equator.  For many applications, xp, yp and
**     (especially) sp can be set to zero.
**
**  3) If theta is Greenwich apparent sidereal time instead of Earth
**     rotation angle, the result is with respect to the true equator
**     and equinox of date, i.e. with the x-axis at the equinox rather
**     than the celestial intermediate origin.
**
**  4) The velocity units are meters per UT1 second, not per SI second.
**     This is unlikely to have any practical consequences in the modern
**     era.
**
**  5) No validation is performed on the arguments.  Error cases that
**     could lead to arithmetic exceptions are trapped by the iauGd2gc
**     function, and the result set to zeros.

**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your

**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into

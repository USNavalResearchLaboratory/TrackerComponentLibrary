**
**  Earth reference ellipsoids.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     n    int         ellipsoid identifier (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     a    double      equatorial radius (meters, Note 2)
**     f    double      flattening (Note 2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**          int         status:  0 = OK
**                              -1 = illegal identifier (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The identifier n is a number that specifies the choice of
**     reference ellipsoid.  The following are supported:
**
**        n    ellipsoid
**
**        1     WGS84
**        2     GRS80
**        3     WGS72
**
**     The n value has no significance outside the SOFA software.  For
**     convenience, symbols WGS84 etc. are defined in sofam.h.
**
**  2) The ellipsoid parameters are returned in the form of equatorial
**     radius in meters (a) and flattening (f).  The latter is a number
**     around 0.00335, i.e. around 1/298.
**
**  3) For the case where an unsupported n value is supplied, zero a and
**     f are returned, as well as error status.

**  SOFA Software License
**  =====================
**
**  NOTICE TO USER:
**
**  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
**  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.
**
**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").
**
**  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
**     restrictions listed below.
**
**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
**     conditions.
*
**  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
**  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
**  appreciated.

**
**  Quick CIRS to ICRS astrometric place transformation, given the star-
**  independent astrometry parameters plus a list of light-deflecting
**  bodies.
**
**  Use of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and
**  where many star positions are all to be transformed for one date.
**  The star-independent astrometry parameters can be obtained by
**  calling one of the functions iauApci[13], iauApcg[13], iauApco[13]
**  or iauApcs[13].
*
*  If the only light-deflecting body to be taken into account is the
*  Sun, the iauAticq function can be used instead.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     ri,di  double      CIRS RA,Dec (radians)
**     astrom iauASTROM*  star-independent astrometry parameters:
**      pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
**      eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)
**      eh     double[3]    Sun to observer (unit vector)
**      em     double       distance from Sun to observer (au)
**      v      double[3]    barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
**      bm1    double       sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
**      bpn    double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix
**      along  double       longitude + s' (radians)
**      xpl    double       polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      ypl    double       polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      sphi   double       sine of geodetic latitude
**      cphi   double       cosine of geodetic latitude
**      diurab double       magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
**      eral   double       "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
**      refa   double       refraction constant A (radians)
**      refb   double       refraction constant B (radians)
**     n      int          number of bodies (Note 3)
**     b      iauLDBODY[n] data for each of the n bodies (Notes 3,4):
**      bm     double       mass of the body (solar masses, Note 5)
**      dl     double       deflection limiter (Note 6)
**      pv     [2][3]       barycentric PV of the body (au, au/day)
**
**  Returned:
**     rc,dc  double     ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) Iterative techniques are used for the aberration and light
**     deflection corrections so that the functions iauAticqn and
**     iauAtciqn are accurate inverses; even at the edge of the Sun's
**     disk the discrepancy is only about 1 nanoarcsecond.
**
**  2) If the only light-deflecting body to be taken into account is the
**     Sun, the iauAticq function can be used instead.
**
**  3) The struct b contains n entries, one for each body to be
**     considered.  If n = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
**     applied, not even for the Sun.
**
**  4) The struct b should include an entry for the Sun as well as for
**     any planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries
**     should be in the order in which the light passes the body.
**
**  5) In the entry in the b struct for body i, the mass parameter
**     b[i].bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such
**     effects as quadrupole field.
**
**  6) The deflection limiter parameter b[i].dl is phi^2/2, where phi is
**     the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at
**     which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
**     threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
**     for phi = 0.   Example values suitable for a terrestrial
**     observer, together with masses, are as follows:
**
**        body i     b[i].bm        b[i].dl
**
**        Sun        1.0            6e-6
**        Jupiter    0.00095435     3e-9
**        Saturn     0.00028574     3e-10
**
**  7) For efficiency, validation of the contents of the b array is
**     omitted.  The supplied masses must be greater than zero, the
**     position and velocity vectors must be right, and the deflection
**     limiter greater than zero.
**
**  Called:
**     iauS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
**     iauTrxp      product of transpose of r-matrix and p-vector
**     iauZp        zero p-vector
**     iauAb        stellar aberration
**     iauLdn       light deflection by n bodies
**     iauC2s       p-vector to spherical

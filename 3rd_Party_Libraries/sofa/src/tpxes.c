**
**  In the tangent plane projection, given celestial spherical
**  coordinates for a star and the tangent point, solve for the star's
**  rectangular coordinates in the tangent plane.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     a,b       double  star's spherical coordinates
**     a0,b0     double  tangent point's spherical coordinates
**
**  Returned:
**     *xi,*eta  double  rectangular coordinates of star image (Note 2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**               int     status:  0 = OK
**                                1 = star too far from axis
**                                2 = antistar on tangent plane
**                                3 = antistar too far from axis
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The tangent plane projection is also called the "gnomonic
**     projection" and the "central projection".
**
**  2) The eta axis points due north in the adopted coordinate system.
**     If the spherical coordinates are observed (RA,Dec), the tangent
**     plane coordinates (xi,eta) are conventionally called the
**     "standard coordinates".  For right-handed spherical coordinates,
**     (xi,eta) are also right-handed.  The units of (xi,eta) are,
**     effectively, radians at the tangent point.
**
**  3) All angular arguments are in radians.
**
**  4) This function is a member of the following set:
**
**         spherical      vector         solve for
**
**       > iauTpxes <    iauTpxev         xi,eta
**         iauTpsts      iauTpstv          star
**         iauTpors      iauTporv         origin

**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not

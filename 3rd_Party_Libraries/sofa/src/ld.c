**
**  Apply light deflection by a solar-system body, as part of
**  transforming coordinate direction into natural direction.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     bm     double     mass of the gravitating body (solar masses)
**     p      double[3]  direction from observer to source (unit vector)
**     q      double[3]  direction from body to source (unit vector)
**     e      double[3]  direction from body to observer (unit vector)
**     em     double     distance from body to observer (au)
**     dlim   double     deflection limiter (Note 4)
**
**  Returned:
**     p1     double[3]  observer to deflected source (unit vector)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The algorithm is based on Expr. (70) in Klioner (2003) and
**     Expr. (7.63) in the Explanatory Supplement (Urban & Seidelmann
**     2013), with some rearrangement to minimize the effects of machine
**     precision.
**
**  2) The mass parameter bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to
**     allow for such effects as quadrupole field.
**
**  3) The barycentric position of the deflecting body should ideally
**     correspond to the time of closest approach of the light ray to
**     the body.
**
**  4) The deflection limiter parameter dlim is phi^2/2, where phi is
**     the angular separation (in radians) between source and body at
**     which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
**     threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
**     for phi = 0.
**
**  5) The returned vector p1 is not normalized, but the consequential
**     departure from unit magnitude is always negligible.
**
**  6) The arguments p and p1 can be the same array.
**
**  7) To accumulate total light deflection taking into account the
**     contributions from several bodies, call the present function for
**     each body in succession, in decreasing order of distance from the
**     observer.
**
**  8) For efficiency, validation is omitted.  The supplied vectors must
**     be of unit magnitude, and the deflection limiter non-zero and
**     positive.

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as

**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and

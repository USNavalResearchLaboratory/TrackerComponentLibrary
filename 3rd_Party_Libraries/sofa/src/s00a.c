**
**  The CIO locator s, positioning the Celestial Intermediate Origin on
**  the equator of the Celestial Intermediate Pole, using the IAU 2000A
**  precession-nutation model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double    TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                  double    the CIO locator s in radians (Note 2)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The CIO locator s is the difference between the right ascensions
**     of the same point in two systems.  The two systems are the GCRS
**     and the CIP,CIO, and the point is the ascending node of the
**     CIP equator.  The CIO locator s remains a small fraction of
**     1 arcsecond throughout 1900-2100.
**
**  3) The series used to compute s is in fact for s+XY/2, where X and Y
**     are the x and y components of the CIP unit vector;  this series
**     is more compact than a direct series for s would be.  The present
**     function uses the full IAU 2000A nutation model when predicting
**     the CIP position.  Faster results, with no significant loss of
**     accuracy, can be obtained via the function iauS00b, which uses
**     instead the IAU 2000B truncated model.

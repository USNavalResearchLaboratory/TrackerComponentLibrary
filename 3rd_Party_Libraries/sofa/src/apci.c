**
**  For a terrestrial observer, prepare star-independent astrometry
**  parameters for transformations between ICRS and geocentric CIRS
**  coordinates.  The Earth ephemeris and CIP/CIO are supplied by the
**  caller.
**
**  The parameters produced by this function are required in the
**  parallax, light deflection, aberration, and bias-precession-nutation
**  parts of the astrometric transformation chain.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

**  Status:  support function.

**     ebpv   double[2][3] Earth barycentric position/velocity (au, au/day)

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
**     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
**     applications of this function the choice will not be at all
**     critical.
**
**     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
**     accuracy.
**
**  2) All the vectors are with respect to BCRS axes.
**
**  3) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
**     ephemeris and CIP/CIO, the function iauApci13 can be used instead
**     of the present function.  This computes the required quantities
**     using other SOFA functions.
**
**  4) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**     The various functions support different classes of observer and
**     portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
**     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**     supplied by the caller.
**
**     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
**
**  5) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
**     iauAtciq* and iauAticq*.

**
**  Transformation from ecliptic coordinates (mean equinox and ecliptic
**  of date) to ICRS RA,Dec, using a long-term precession model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     epj     double     Julian epoch (TT)
**     dl,db   double     ecliptic longitude and latitude (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     dr,dd   double     ICRS right ascension and declination (radians)
**
**  1) No assumptions are made about whether the coordinates represent
**     starlight and embody astrometric effects such as parallax or
**     aberration.
**
**  2) The transformation is approximately that from ecliptic longitude
**     and latitude (mean equinox and ecliptic of date) to mean J2000.0
**     right ascension and declination, with only frame bias (always
**     less than 25 mas) to disturb this classical picture.
**
**  3) The Vondrak et al. (2011, 2012) 400 millennia precession model
**     agrees with the IAU 2006 precession at J2000.0 and stays within
**     100 microarcseconds during the 20th and 21st centuries.  It is
**     accurate to a few arcseconds throughout the historical period,
**     worsening to a few tenths of a degree at the end of the
**     +/- 200,000 year time span.
**
**  Called:
**     iauS2c       spherical coordinates to unit vector
**     iauLtecm     J2000.0 to ecliptic rotation matrix, long term
**     iauTrxp      product of transpose of r-matrix and p-vector
**     iauC2s       unit vector to spherical coordinates
**     iauAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
**     iauAnpm      normalize angle into range +/- pi

**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the

**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and

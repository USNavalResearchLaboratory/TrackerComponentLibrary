**
**  Transform ICRS star data, epoch J2000.0, to CIRS.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     rc     double  ICRS right ascension at J2000.0 (radians, Note 1)
**     dc     double  ICRS declination at J2000.0 (radians, Note 1)
**     pr     double  RA proper motion (radians/year, Note 2)
**     pd     double  Dec proper motion (radians/year)
**     px     double  parallax (arcsec)
**     rv     double  radial velocity (km/s, +ve if receding)
**     date1  double  TDB as a 2-part...
**     date2  double  ...Julian Date (Note 3)
**
**  Returned:
**     ri,di  double* CIRS geocentric RA,Dec (radians)
**     eo     double* equation of the origins (ERA-GST, radians, Note 5)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) Star data for an epoch other than J2000.0 (for example from the
**     Hipparcos catalog, which has an epoch of J1991.25) will require a
**     preliminary call to iauPmsafe before use.
**
**  2) The proper motion in RA is dRA/dt rather than cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.
**
**  3) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
**     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
**     applications of this function the choice will not be at all
**     critical.
**
**     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
**     accuracy.
**
**  4) The available accuracy is better than 1 milliarcsecond, limited
**     mainly by the precession-nutation model that is used, namely
**     IAU 2000A/2006.  Very close to solar system bodies, additional
**     errors of up to several milliarcseconds can occur because of
**     unmodeled light deflection;  however, the Sun's contribution is
**     taken into account, to first order.  The accuracy limitations of
**     the SOFA function iauEpv00 (used to compute Earth position and
**     velocity) can contribute aberration errors of up to
**     5 microarcseconds.  Light deflection at the Sun's limb is
**     uncertain at the 0.4 mas level.
**
**  5) Should the transformation to (equinox based) apparent place be
**     required rather than (CIO based) intermediate place, subtract the
**     equation of the origins from the returned right ascension:
**     RA = RI - EO. (The iauAnp function can then be applied, as
**     required, to keep the result in the conventional 0-2pi range.)

**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions

**                           0 = no warnings or errors

**                        else = binary logical OR of the above warnings
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The starting and ending TDB dates ep1a+ep1b and ep2a+ep2b are
**     Julian Dates, apportioned in any convenient way between the two
**     parts (A and B).  For example, JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be
**     expressed in any of these ways, among others:
**
**            epNa            epNb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
**     good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) In accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's
**     right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of
**     secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog
**     equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.
**
**     The proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension
**     and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB
**     Julian year.
**
**     The parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.
**
**  3) Care is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians
**     and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the
**     parallax is in arcseconds.
**
**  4) The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true
**     angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper
**     motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec)
**     before use.
**
**  5) Straight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is
**     assumed.
**
**  6) An extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is overridden
**     to ensure that the object is at a finite but very large distance,
**     but not so large that the proper motion is equivalent to a large
**     but safe speed (about 0.1c using the chosen constant).  A warning
**     status of 1 is added to the status if this action has been taken.
**
**  7) If the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the
**     constant VMAX in the function iauStarpv), it is arbitrarily set
**     to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.
**
**  8) The relativistic adjustment carried out in the iauStarpv function
**     involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to
**     converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the
**     status.

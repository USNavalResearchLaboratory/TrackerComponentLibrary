**
**  Time scale transformation:  Coordinated Universal Time, UTC, to
**  Universal Time, UT1.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     utc1,utc2  double   UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 1-4)
**     dut1       double   Delta UT1 = UT1-UTC in seconds (Note 5)
**
**  Returned:
**     ut11,ut12  double   UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 6)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 3)
**                                  0 = OK
**                                 -1 = unacceptable date
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
**     is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.
**
**  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
**     function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the
**     length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**  3) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
**
**  4) The function iauDtf2d converts from calendar date and time of
**     day into 2-part Julian Date, and in the case of UTC implements
**     the leap-second-ambiguity convention described above.
**
**  5) Delta UT1 can be obtained from tabulations provided by the
**     International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.
**     It is the caller's responsibility to supply a dut1 argument
**     containing the UT1-UTC value that matches the given UTC.
**
**  6) The returned ut11,ut12 are such that their sum is the UT1 Julian
**     Date.

**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
**     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
**     conditions.

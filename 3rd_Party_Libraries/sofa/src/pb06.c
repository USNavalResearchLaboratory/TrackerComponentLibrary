**
**  This function forms three Euler angles which implement general
**  precession from epoch J2000.0, using the IAU 2006 model.  Frame
**  bias (the offset between ICRS and mean J2000.0) is included.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     bzeta        double   1st rotation: radians cw around z
**     bz           double   3rd rotation: radians cw around z
**     btheta       double   2nd rotation: radians ccw around y
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The traditional accumulated precession angles zeta_A, z_A,
**     theta_A cannot be obtained in the usual way, namely through
**     polynomial expressions, because of the frame bias.  The latter
**     means that two of the angles undergo rapid changes near this
**     date.  They are instead the results of decomposing the
**     precession-bias matrix obtained by using the Fukushima-Williams
**     method, which does not suffer from the problem.  The
**     decomposition returns values which can be used in the
**     conventional formulation and which include frame bias.
**
**  3) The three angles are returned in the conventional order, which
**     is not the same as the order of the corresponding Euler
**     rotations.  The precession-bias matrix is
**     R_3(-z) x R_2(+theta) x R_3(-zeta).
**
**  4) Should zeta_A, z_A, theta_A angles be required that do not
**     contain frame bias, they are available by calling the SOFA
**     function iauP06e.

**  Convert position/velocity from Cartesian to spherical coordinates.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  vector/matrix support function.
**
**  Given:
**     pv       double[2][3]  pv-vector
**
**  Returned:
**     theta    double        longitude angle (radians)
**     phi      double        latitude angle (radians)
**     r        double        radial distance
**     td       double        rate of change of theta
**     pd       double        rate of change of phi
**     rd       double        rate of change of r
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) If the position part of pv is null, theta, phi, td and pd
**     are indeterminate.  This is handled by extrapolating the
**     position through unit time by using the velocity part of
**     pv.  This moves the origin without changing the direction
**     of the velocity component.  If the position and velocity
**     components of pv are both null, zeroes are returned for all
**     six results.
**
**  2) If the position is a pole, theta, td and pd are indeterminate.
**     In such cases zeroes are returned for all three.

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.

**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TDB)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way the
**     argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum
**     resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both
**     good compromises between resolution and convenience.  For most
**     applications of this function the choice will not be at all
**     critical.
**
**     TT can be used instead of TDB without any significant impact on
**     accuracy.
**
**  2) The vectors eb, eh, and all the astrom vectors, are with respect
**     to BCRS axes.
**
**  3) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
**     reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN
**     CONVENTION:  the longitude required by the present function is
**     right-handed, i.e. east-positive, in accordance with geographical
**     convention.
**
**  4) xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
**     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the
**     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator
**     s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate
**     Origin on the equator.  For many applications, xp, yp and
**     (especially) sp can be set to zero.
**
**     Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
**     local meridian.
**
**  5) The refraction constants refa and refb are for use in a
**     dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
**     (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
**     refraction.
**
**  6) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
**     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
**     accordance with the models used.
**
**  7) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
**     Ephemeris, the Earth rotation information and refraction
**     constants, the function iauApco13 can be used instead of the
**     present function.  This starts from UTC and weather readings etc.
**     and computes suitable values using other SOFA functions.
**
**  8) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**     The various functions support different classes of observer and
**     portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
**     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**     supplied by the caller.
**
**     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
**
**  9) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
**     iauAtioq, iauAtoiq, iauAtciq* and iauAticq*.
**
**  Called:
**     iauAper      astrometry parameters: update ERA
**     iauC2ixys    celestial-to-intermediate matrix, given X,Y and s
**     iauPvtob     position/velocity of terrestrial station
**     iauTrxpv     product of transpose of r-matrix and pv-vector
**     iauApcs      astrometry parameters, ICRS-GCRS, space observer
**     iauCr        copy r-matrix

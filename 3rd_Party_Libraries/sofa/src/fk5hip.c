**
**  FK5 to Hipparcos rotation and spin.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Returned:
**     r5h   double[3][3]  r-matrix: FK5 rotation wrt Hipparcos (Note 2)
**     s5h   double[3]     r-vector: FK5 spin wrt Hipparcos (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) This function models the FK5 to Hipparcos transformation as a
**     pure rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
**     not taken into account.
**
**  2) The r-matrix r5h operates in the sense:
**
**           P_Hipparcos = r5h x P_FK5
**
**     where P_FK5 is a p-vector in the FK5 frame, and P_Hipparcos is
**     the equivalent Hipparcos p-vector.
**
**  3) The r-vector s5h represents the time derivative of the FK5 to
**     Hipparcos rotation.  The units are radians per year (Julian,
**     TDB).

**     iauRv2m      r-vector to r-matrix

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the

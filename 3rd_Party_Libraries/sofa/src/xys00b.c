**
**  For a given TT date, compute the X,Y coordinates of the Celestial
**  Intermediate Pole and the CIO locator s, using the IAU 2000B
**  precession-nutation model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2  double   TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     x,y          double   Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 2)
**     s            double   the CIO locator s (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y
**     components of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial
**     Reference System.
**
**  3) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
**     Intermediate Origin on the equator of the CIP.
**
**  4) The present function is faster, but slightly less accurate (about
**     1 mas in X,Y), than the iauXys00a function.
**
**  Called:
**     iauPnm00b    classical NPB matrix, IAU 2000B
**     iauBpn2xy    extract CIP X,Y coordinates from NPB matrix
**     iauS00       the CIO locator s, given X,Y, IAU 2000A

**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from

**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the

**
**  For a star, apply light deflection by multiple solar-system bodies,
**  as part of transforming coordinate direction into natural direction.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     n    int           number of bodies (note 1)
**     b    iauLDBODY[n]  data for each of the n bodies (Notes 1,2):
**      bm   double         mass of the body (solar masses, Note 3)
**      dl   double         deflection limiter (Note 4)
**      pv   [2][3]         barycentric PV of the body (au, au/day)
**     ob   double[3]     barycentric position of the observer (au)
**     sc   double[3]     observer to star coord direction (unit vector)
**
**  Returned:
**     sn    double[3]      observer to deflected star (unit vector)
**
**  1) The array b contains n entries, one for each body to be
**     considered.  If n = 0, no gravitational light deflection will be
**     applied, not even for the Sun.
**
**  2) The array b should include an entry for the Sun as well as for
**     any planet or other body to be taken into account.  The entries
**     should be in the order in which the light passes the body.
**
**  3) In the entry in the b array for body i, the mass parameter
**     b[i].bm can, as required, be adjusted in order to allow for such
**     effects as quadrupole field.
**
**  4) The deflection limiter parameter b[i].dl is phi^2/2, where phi is
**     the angular separation (in radians) between star and body at
**     which limiting is applied.  As phi shrinks below the chosen
**     threshold, the deflection is artificially reduced, reaching zero
**     for phi = 0.   Example values suitable for a terrestrial
**     observer, together with masses, are as follows:
**
**        body i     b[i].bm        b[i].dl
**
**        Sun        1.0            6e-6
**        Jupiter    0.00095435     3e-9
**        Saturn     0.00028574     3e-10
**
**  5) For cases where the starlight passes the body before reaching the
**     observer, the body is placed back along its barycentric track by
**     the light time from that point to the observer.  For cases where
**     the body is "behind" the observer no such shift is applied.  If
**     a different treatment is preferred, the user has the option of
**     instead using the iauLd function.  Similarly, iauLd can be used
**     for cases where the source is nearby, not a star.
**
**  6) The returned vector sn is not normalized, but the consequential
**     departure from unit magnitude is always negligible.
**
**  7) The arguments sc and sn can be the same array.
**
**  8) For efficiency, validation is omitted.  The supplied masses must
**     be greater than zero, the position and velocity vectors must be
**     right, and the deflection limiter greater than zero.

**  Quick observed place to CIRS, given the star-independent astrometry
**  parameters.
**
**  Use of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and
**  where many star positions are all to be transformed for one date.
**  The star-independent astrometry parameters can be obtained by
**  calling iauApio[13] or iauApco[13].
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     type   char[]     type of coordinates: "R", "H" or "A" (Note 1)
**     ob1    double     observed Az, HA or RA (radians; Az is N=0,E=90)
**     ob2    double     observed ZD or Dec (radians)
**     astrom iauASTROM* star-independent astrometry parameters:
**      pmt    double       PM time interval (SSB, Julian years)
**      eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)
**      eh     double[3]    Sun to observer (unit vector)
**      em     double       distance from Sun to observer (au)
**      v      double[3]    barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
**      bm1    double       sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
**      bpn    double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix
**      along  double       longitude + s' (radians)
**      xpl    double       polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      ypl    double       polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      sphi   double       sine of geodetic latitude
**      cphi   double       cosine of geodetic latitude
**      diurab double       magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
**      eral   double       "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
**      refa   double       refraction constant A (radians)
**      refb   double       refraction constant B (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     ri     double*    CIRS right ascension (CIO-based, radians)
**     di     double*    CIRS declination (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) "Observed" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a
**     perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  This is related to
**     the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using the geodetic
**     latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the observed HA and
**     (CIO-based) RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
**     angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
**     means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
**     with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.
**
**  2) Only the first character of the type argument is significant.
**     "R" or "r" indicates that ob1 and ob2 are the observed right
**     ascension (CIO-based) and declination;  "H" or "h" indicates that
**     they are hour angle (west +ve) and declination;  anything else
**     ("A" or "a" is recommended) indicates that ob1 and ob2 are
**     azimuth (north zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.  (Zenith
**     distance is used rather than altitude in order to reflect the
**     fact that no allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)
**
**  3) The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
**     refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.
**     Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and
**     there are no gross local effects, the predicted intermediate
**     coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec
**     (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better
**     than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better than
**     20 arcmin (optical) or 25 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.
**
**     Without refraction, the complementary functions iauAtioq and
**     iauAtoiq are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond all
**     over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included, consistency
**     falls off at high zenith distances, but is still better than
**     0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.
**
**  4) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
**     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
**     accordance with the models used.

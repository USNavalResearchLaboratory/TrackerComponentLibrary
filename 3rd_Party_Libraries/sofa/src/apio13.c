**
**  For a terrestrial observer, prepare star-independent astrometry

**  conditions and observing wavelength.

**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.

**      eb     double[3]    unchanged

**
**  Returned (function value):
**            int         status: +1 = dubious year (Note 2)
**                                 0 = OK
**                                -1 = unacceptable date
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  utc1+utc2 is quasi Julian Date (see Note 2), apportioned in any
**      convenient way between the two arguments, for example where utc1
**      is the Julian Day Number and utc2 is the fraction of a day.
**
**      However, JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap
**      second unless special measures are taken.  The convention in the
**      present function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether
**      the length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.
**
**      Applications should use the function iauDtf2d to convert from
**      calendar date and time of day into 2-part quasi Julian Date, as
**      it implements the leap-second-ambiguity convention just
**      described.
**
**  2)  The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**      introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
**      to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.
**
**  3)  UT1-UTC is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It increases by exactly
**      one second at the end of each positive UTC leap second,
**      introduced in order to keep UT1-UTC within +/- 0.9s.  n.b. This
**      practice is under review, and in the future UT1-UTC may grow
**      essentially without limit.
**
**  4)  The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
**      reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
**      longitude required by the present function is east-positive
**      (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
**
**  5)  The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
**      values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
**      Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
**      Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
**      meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
**      xp and yp can be set to zero.
**
**      Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto
**      the local meridian.
**
**  6)  If hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station
**      in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is
**      available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the
**      expression
**
**            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );
**
**      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
**      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
**      52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be
**      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
**      follows:
**
**            phpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
**
**      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to the
**      pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for
**      precise work.
**
**  7)  The argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in
**      micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to
**      occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).
**
**  8)  It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
**      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
**      accordance with the models used.
**
**  9)  In cases where the caller wishes to supply his own Earth
**      rotation information and refraction constants, the function
**      iauApc can be used instead of the present function.
**
**  10) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**      structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**      astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**      The various functions support different classes of observer and
**      portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**      Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
**      compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**      supplied by the caller.
**
**      The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**      parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**      comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**      observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**      aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**      transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
**
**  11) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used
**      by iauAtioq and iauAtoiq.

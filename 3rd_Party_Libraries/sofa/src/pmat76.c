**
**  Precession matrix from J2000.0 to a specified date, IAU 1976 model.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2 double       ending date, TT (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     rmatp       double[3][3] precession matrix, J2000.0 -> date1+date2
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The matrix operates in the sense V(date) = RMATP * V(J2000),
**     where the p-vector V(J2000) is with respect to the mean
**     equatorial triad of epoch J2000.0 and the p-vector V(date)
**     is with respect to the mean equatorial triad of the given
**     date.
**
**  3) Though the matrix method itself is rigorous, the precession
**     angles are expressed through canonical polynomials which are
**     valid only for a limited time span.  In addition, the IAU 1976
**     precession rate is known to be imperfect.  The absolute accuracy
**     of the present formulation is better than 0.1 arcsec from
**     1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD,
**     and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of the period
**     500BC to 3000AD.  The errors exceed 10 arcsec outside the
**     range 1200BC to 3900AD, exceed 100 arcsec outside 4200BC to
**     5600AD and exceed 1000 arcsec outside 6800BC to 8200AD.
**
**  Called:
**     iauPrec76    accumulated precession angles, IAU 1976

**     iauRz        rotate around Z-axis

**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not

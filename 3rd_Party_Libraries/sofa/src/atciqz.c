**
**  Quick ICRS to CIRS transformation, given precomputed star-
**  independent astrometry parameters, and assuming zero parallax and
**  proper motion.
**
**  Use of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and
**  where many star positions are to be transformed for one date.  The
**  star-independent parameters can be obtained by calling one of the
**  functions iauApci[13], iauApcg[13], iauApco[13] or iauApcs[13].
**
**  The corresponding function for the case of non-zero parallax and
**  proper motion is iauAtciq.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     rc,dc  double     ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)
**     astrom iauASTROM* star-independent astrometry parameters:

**      eb     double[3]    SSB to observer (vector, au)
**      eh     double[3]    Sun to observer (unit vector)
**      em     double       distance from Sun to observer (au)
**      v      double[3]    barycentric observer velocity (vector, c)
**      bm1    double       sqrt(1-|v|^2): reciprocal of Lorenz factor
**      bpn    double[3][3] bias-precession-nutation matrix
**      along  double       longitude + s' (radians)
**      xpl    double       polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      ypl    double       polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      sphi   double       sine of geodetic latitude
**      cphi   double       cosine of geodetic latitude
**      diurab double       magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
**      eral   double       "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
**      refa   double       refraction constant A (radians)
**      refb   double       refraction constant B (radians)
**
**  Returned:

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into

**
**  Frame bias components of IAU 2000 precession-nutation models;  part
**  of the Mathews-Herring-Buffett (MHB2000) nutation series, with
**  additions.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsibi,depsbi  double  longitude and obliquity corrections
**     dra            double  the ICRS RA of the J2000.0 mean equinox
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The frame bias corrections in longitude and obliquity (radians)
**     are required in order to correct for the offset between the GCRS
**     pole and the mean J2000.0 pole.  They define, with respect to the
**     GCRS frame, a J2000.0 mean pole that is consistent with the rest
**     of the IAU 2000A precession-nutation model.
**
**  2) In addition to the displacement of the pole, the complete
**     description of the frame bias requires also an offset in right
**     ascension.  This is not part of the IAU 2000A model, and is from
**     Chapront et al. (2002).  It is returned in radians.
**
**  3) This is a supplemented implementation of one aspect of the IAU
**     2000A nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General
**     Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

**
**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").

**     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
**     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and

**
**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as

**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
**     conditions.

**
**  Form the celestial to terrestrial matrix given the date, the UT1,
**  the nutation and the polar motion.  IAU 2000.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     tta,ttb    double        TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     uta,utb    double        UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**     dpsi,deps  double        nutation (Note 2)
**     xp,yp      double        coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 3)
**
**  Returned:
**     rc2t       double[3][3]  celestial-to-terrestrial matrix (Note 4)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT and UT1 dates tta+ttb and uta+utb are Julian Dates,
**     apportioned in any convenient way between the arguments uta and
**     utb.  For example, JD(UT1)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of
**     these ways, among others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  In the case of uta,utb, the
**     date & time method is best matched to the Earth rotation angle
**     algorithm used:  maximum precision is delivered when the uta
**     argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in question and the utb
**     argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice versa.
**
**  2) The caller is responsible for providing the nutation components;
**     they are in longitude and obliquity, in radians and are with
**     respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  For high-accuracy
**     applications, free core nutation should be included as well as
**     any other relevant corrections to the position of the CIP.
**
**  3) The arguments xp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the
**     Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International
**     Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003),
**     measured along the meridians to 0 and 90 deg west respectively.
**
**  4) The matrix rc2t transforms from celestial to terrestrial
**     coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(GST) * RBPN * [CRS]
**
**              = rc2t * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), RBPN is the
**     bias-precession-nutation matrix, GST is the Greenwich (apparent)
**     Sidereal Time and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  5) Although its name does not include "00", This function is in fact
**     specific to the IAU 2000 models.
**
**  Called:
**     iauPn00      bias/precession/nutation results, IAU 2000
**     iauGmst00    Greenwich mean sidereal time, IAU 2000
**     iauSp00      the TIO locator s', IERS 2000
**     iauEe00      equation of the equinoxes, IAU 2000
**     iauPom00     polar motion matrix
**     iauC2teqx    form equinox-based celestial-to-terrestrial matrix

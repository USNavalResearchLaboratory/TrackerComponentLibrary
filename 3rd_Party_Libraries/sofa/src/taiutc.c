**
**  Time scale transformation:  International Atomic Time, TAI, to
**  Coordinated Universal Time, UTC.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical.
**
**  Given:
**     tai1,tai2  double   TAI as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     utc1,utc2  double   UTC as a 2-part quasi Julian Date (Notes 1-3)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                int      status: +1 = dubious year (Note 4)
**                                  0 = OK
**                                 -1 = unacceptable date
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) tai1+tai2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way
**     between the two arguments, for example where tai1 is the Julian
**     Day Number and tai2 is the fraction of a day.  The returned utc1
**     and utc2 form an analogous pair, except that a special convention
**     is used, to deal with the problem of leap seconds - see the next
**     note.
**
**  2) JD cannot unambiguously represent UTC during a leap second unless
**     special measures are taken.  The convention in the present
**     function is that the JD day represents UTC days whether the
**     length is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds.  In the 1960-1972 era
**     there were smaller jumps (in either direction) each time the
**     linear UTC(TAI) expression was changed, and these "mini-leaps"
**     are also included in the SOFA convention.
**
**  3) The function iauD2dtf can be used to transform the UTC quasi-JD
**     into calendar date and clock time, including UTC leap second
**     handling.
**
**  4) The warning status "dubious year" flags UTCs that predate the
**     introduction of the time scale or that are too far in the future
**     to be trusted.  See iauDat for further details.

**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**

**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
**     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as

**     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
**     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
**     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
**     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
**     claim by any third party.
**
**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
**     conditions.

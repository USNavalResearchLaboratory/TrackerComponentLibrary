**
**  For a terrestrial observer, prepare star-independent astrometry
**  parameters for transformations between CIRS and observed
**  coordinates.  The caller supplies the Earth orientation information
**  and the refraction constants as well as the site coordinates.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     sp     double      the TIO locator s' (radians, Note 1)
**     theta  double      Earth rotation angle (radians)
**     elong  double      longitude (radians, east +ve, Note 2)
**     phi    double      geodetic latitude (radians, Note 2)
**     hm     double      height above ellipsoid (m, geodetic Note 2)
**     xp,yp  double      polar motion coordinates (radians, Note 3)
**     refa   double      refraction constant A (radians, Note 4)
**     refb   double      refraction constant B (radians, Note 4)
**
**  Returned:
**     astrom iauASTROM*  star-independent astrometry parameters:
**      pmt    double       unchanged
**      eb     double[3]    unchanged
**      eh     double[3]    unchanged

**      bpn    double[3][3] unchanged
**      along  double       longitude + s' (radians)
**      xpl    double       polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      ypl    double       polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      sphi   double       sine of geodetic latitude
**      cphi   double       cosine of geodetic latitude
**      diurab double       magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
**      eral   double       "local" Earth rotation angle (radians)
**      refa   double       refraction constant A (radians)
**      refb   double       refraction constant B (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) sp, the TIO locator s', is a tiny quantity needed only by the
**     most precise applications.  It can either be set to zero or
**     predicted using the SOFA function iauSp00.
**
**  2) The geographical coordinates are with respect to the WGS84
**     reference ellipsoid.  TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN:  the
**     longitude required by the present function is east-positive
**     (i.e. right-handed), in accordance with geographical convention.
**
**  3) The polar motion xp,yp can be obtained from IERS bulletins.  The
**     values are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial
**     Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), measured along the
**     meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  For many applications,
**     xp and yp can be set to zero.
**
**     Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto the
**     local meridian.
**
**  4) The refraction constants refa and refb are for use in a
**     dZ = A*tan(Z)+B*tan^3(Z) model, where Z is the observed
**     (i.e. refracted) zenith distance and dZ is the amount of
**     refraction.
**
**  5) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
**     values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
**     accordance with the models used.
**
**  6) In cases where the caller does not wish to provide the Earth
**     rotation information and refraction constants, the function
**     iauApio13 can be used instead of the present function.  This
**     starts from UTC and weather readings etc. and computes suitable
**     values using other SOFA functions.
**
**  7) This is one of several functions that inserts into the astrom
**     structure star-independent parameters needed for the chain of
**     astrometric transformations ICRS <-> GCRS <-> CIRS <-> observed.
**
**     The various functions support different classes of observer and
**     portions of the transformation chain:
**
**          functions         observer        transformation
**
**       iauApcg iauApcg13    geocentric      ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauApci iauApci13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> CIRS
**       iauApco iauApco13    terrestrial     ICRS <-> observed
**       iauApcs iauApcs13    space           ICRS <-> GCRS
**       iauAper iauAper13    terrestrial     update Earth rotation
**       iauApio iauApio13    terrestrial     CIRS <-> observed
**
**     Those with names ending in "13" use contemporary SOFA models to
**     compute the various ephemerides.  The others accept ephemerides
**     supplied by the caller.
**
**     The transformation from ICRS to GCRS covers space motion,
**     parallax, light deflection, and aberration.  From GCRS to CIRS
**     comprises frame bias and precession-nutation.  From CIRS to
**     observed takes account of Earth rotation, polar motion, diurnal
**     aberration and parallax (unless subsumed into the ICRS <-> GCRS
**     transformation), and atmospheric refraction.
**
**  8) The context structure astrom produced by this function is used by
**     iauAtioq and iauAtoiq.

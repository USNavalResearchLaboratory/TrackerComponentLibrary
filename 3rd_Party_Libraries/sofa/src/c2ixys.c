**
**  Form the celestial to intermediate-frame-of-date matrix given the CIP
**  X,Y and the CIO locator s.
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     x,y      double         Celestial Intermediate Pole (Note 1)
**     s        double         the CIO locator s (Note 2)
**
**  Returned:
**     rc2i     double[3][3]   celestial-to-intermediate matrix (Note 3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The Celestial Intermediate Pole coordinates are the x,y
**     components of the unit vector in the Geocentric Celestial
**     Reference System.
**
**  2) The CIO locator s (in radians) positions the Celestial
**     Intermediate Origin on the equator of the CIP.
**
**  3) The matrix rc2i is the first stage in the transformation from
**     celestial to terrestrial coordinates:
**
**        [TRS] = RPOM * R_3(ERA) * rc2i * [CRS]
**
**              = RC2T * [CRS]
**
**     where [CRS] is a vector in the Geocentric Celestial Reference
**     System and [TRS] is a vector in the International Terrestrial
**     Reference System (see IERS Conventions 2003), ERA is the Earth
**     Rotation Angle and RPOM is the polar motion matrix.
**
**  Called:
**     iauIr        initialize r-matrix to identity
**     iauRz        rotate around Z-axis
**     iauRy        rotate around Y-axis

**
**  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board ("SOFA").

**
**  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
**     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
**     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
**     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
**     of SOFA source code files is a "derived work" that must comply
**     with the following requirements:
**
**     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
**        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
**        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
**        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
**        endorsed by SOFA.
**
**     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
**        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
**        from the original SOFA software.
**
**     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
**        include the prefix "iau" or "sofa" or trivial modifications
**        thereof such as changes of case.
**
**     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
**        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
**        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
**        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.
**
**     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
**        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
**        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
**        derived work.
**
**     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
**     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
**     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
**     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
**     such, as explained above.
**
**  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
**     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
**     by inappropriate modification.
**
**  5. The SOFA software is provided "as is" and SOFA makes no warranty
**     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
**     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the

**  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
**     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
**     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
**     conditions.

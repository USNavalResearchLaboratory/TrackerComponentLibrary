**
**  Precession-rate part of the IAU 2000 precession-nutation models
**  (part of MHB2000).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  canonical model.
**
**  Given:
**     date1,date2    double  TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)
**
**  Returned:
**     dpsipr,depspr  double  precession corrections (Notes 2,3)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the two arguments.  For example,
**     JD(TT)=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways,
**     among others:
**
**            date1          date2
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in
**     cases where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution
**     is acceptable.  The J2000 method is best matched to the way
**     the argument is handled internally and will deliver the
**     optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods
**     are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.
**
**  2) The precession adjustments are expressed as "nutation
**     components", corrections in longitude and obliquity with respect
**     to the J2000.0 equinox and ecliptic.
**
**  3) Although the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect
**     to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which
**     set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to
**     be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to
**     adopt the 4-rotation epsilon_0, psi_A, omega_A, xi_A option, and
**     to add dpsipr to psi_A and depspr to both omega_A and eps_A.
**
**  4) This is an implementation of one aspect of the IAU 2000A nutation
**     model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000,
**     namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002).

This is the list of updates and changes that are actual errors.  
Additions, such as including the units "radians", and/or typographical 
alterations are not listed.  They include changing capitalisation, e.g.  
AU -> au and Of -> of, and consistent spelling i.e. catalogue -> catalog.

Additions to Cookbooks

Forty SOFA routines are not mentioned in the existing cookbooks; in
some cases simply because the routine was developed after the relevant
cookbook had been written. To address this deficiency, enhancements
have been drafted to two of the existing cookbooks (those on astrometry
and Earth attitude) and a new one (on miscellaneous topics) has been
written. This new cookbook is available for each distribution i.e.
sofa_misc_f.pdf for Fortran and sofa_misc_c.pdf for ANSI C. Topics
include ecliptic and galactic coordinates, Hipparcos/FK5 and FK4/FK5
transformations, geodesy and solar-system ephemerides.

David Vallado's original distribution came with implementations in C++, Fortran, Microsoft Excel, Matlab, and Pascal. Only the C++ implementation is retained here and is called as an external library by a mex function to run the SGP 4 propagator. The code has been slightly modified to eliminate all warnings when compiled with the -Weverything option under Clang, except for the Wcovered-switch-default warning. For example, a few unused variables were eliminated. Also, the debugging code and the IO code as well as files containing helper functions for the IO code have been removed as they is not used in the Tracker Library. The definition of pi had to be moved from sgp4unit.h to sgp4unit.cpp to avoid a namespace conflict with one of Matlab's headers.

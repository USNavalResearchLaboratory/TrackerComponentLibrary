David Vallado's original distribution came with implementations in C++,
Fortran, Microsoft Excel, Matlab, and Pascal. Only the C++ implementation
is retained here and is called as an external library by a mex function to
run the SGP 4 propagator.  The documentation files appearing in AIAA
journals have been superseded by the publication:

Spacetrack Report #3," AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference and
Exhibit, Guidance, Navigation, and Control and Co-located Conferences,

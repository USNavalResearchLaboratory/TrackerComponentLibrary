Most of the code in GeographicLib (such as C, Fortran, and Java
implementations) is not used and was archived into ./Unused Files.zip,
./src/Unused Files.zip, ./include/Unused Files.zip, and
./include/GeographicLib/Unused Files.zip

Though there is a direct Matlab version of GeographicLib, it is slower than
writing an interface to the C++ implementation.

The code was originally taken from

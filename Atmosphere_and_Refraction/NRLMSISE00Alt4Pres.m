function [altitude,gasTable,t,d]=NRLMSISE00Alt4Pres(dayOfYear,secondOfTheDay,pressure,latLon,AP,F107,F107A) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%NRLMSISE00ALT4PRES Given the pressure at a particular latitude and
%                   longitude and time, obtain the approximate ellipsoidal
%                   height using the NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model. This
%                   function also returns a standard temperature and the
%                   constitutents of the atmosphere, assuming dry air. The
%                   pressure returned is consistent with the function
%                   NRLMSISE00GasTemp, but will not be perfectly
%                   consistent with the function standardAtmosParam.
%
%INPUTS: dayOfYear The integer day of the year in the Gregorian calendar
%                  in universal coordinated time (UTC). Counting starts at
%                  1. the resolution of the model is not sufficient for it
%                  to matter whether 365 or 366 is given at the day if it
%                  isn't/is a leap year.
%   secondOfTheDay The second of the day. This starts at zero. The
%                  resolution of the model is not high enough for leap
%                  seconds to matter, so values above 86400.0 are just
%                  clipped to 86400.0.
%         pressure The measured atmospheirc pressure in Pascals.
%           latLon WGS-84 latitude and longitude of the point where the
%                  pressure is measured.
%               Ap An optional parameter specifying the average daily
%                  geomagnetic index. If omitted, the value 4.0, which is
%                  suitable for models below 90km is used. The index at a
%                  particular time can be obtained from a service of the
%                  International Service of Geomagnetic Indices at
%                  http://www-app3.gfz-potsdam.de/kp_index/
%                  A scalar value of AP indicates standard mode. If a 7X1
%                  vector is passed, then it is assumed that storm mode is
%                  desired. In storm mode, Ap(1) is the daily Ap index.
%                  Ap(2) through Ap(5) are 3 hours Ap indices respectively
%                  for the current time and 3, 6, and 9 hours before the
%                  current time. Ap(6) is the average of 8 3-hour Ap
%                  indices from 12 to 33 hours prior to the current time
%                  and Ap(7) is the average of 8 3-hour Ap indices from 36
%                  to 59 hours prior to the current time.
%             F107 An optional parameter specifying the 10.7cm solar radio
%                  flux for the previous day. If omitted, a value of 150
%                  is used, which should be suitable for models below
%                  90km. Values of the index can be obtained from
%                  http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/indices/quar_DSD.txt
%            F107A An optional parameter specifying the 81 day average of
%                  the 10.7cm radio solar flux. If omitted, a value of 150
%                  is used, which should be suitable for models below 90km.

%OUTPUTS: altitude The approximate ellipsoidal altitude associated with
%                  the pressure given on the input in meters.
%         gasTable A cell array of constituent elements of the atmosphere
%                  and their number densities. gasTable{i,1} is a string
%                  listing the name of the ith constituent element of the
%                  atmosphere. This can take the values
%                  'He' Helium
%                  'O'  Elemental Oxygen
%                  'N2' Nitrogen
%                  'O2' Oxygen
%                  'Ar' Argon
%                  'H'  Elemental Hydrogen
%                  'N'  Elemental Nitrogen
%                  'O*' Anomalous Oxygen
%                  gasTable{i,2} is the corresponding number density of
%                  the ith constituent element in units of atoms per cubic
%                  meter.
%                t Temperature variables. t(1) is the exospheric
%                  temperature and t(2) is the temperature at altitude.
%                  The temperature is in units of Kelvin.
%                d A 9X1 vector containing the same information as
%                  gasTable but without labels. The entries in d are
%                  d(1) - HE NUMBER DENSITY
%                  d(2) - O NUMBER DENSITY
%                  d(3) - N2 NUMBER DENSITY
%                  d(4) - O2 NUMBER DENSITY
%                  d(5) - AR NUMBER DENSITY                       
%                  d(6) - TOTAL MASS DENSITY without d(9)
%                  d(7) - H NUMBER DENSITY
%                  d(8) - N NUMBER DENSITY
%                  d(9) - Anomalous oxygen NUMBER DENSITY(M-3)
%                  where all number densities are in units of atoms per
%                  cubic meter and the units of d(6) are kilograms per
%                  cubic meter. Note that d(6) is computed using a
%                  definition of the atomic mass unit and definitions of
%                  the atomic masses that are not necessarily the most up
%                  to date.
%
%This function is essentially a wrapper for the C-code implementation of
%the  NRLMSISE-00 atmospheric model using appropriate functions to put the
%time and location in the correct format. The model is described in [1].
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[altitude,gasTable,t,d]=NRLMSISE00Alt4Pres(dayOfYear,secondOfTheDay,pressure,latLon);
%or
%[altitude,gasTable,t,d]=NRLMSISE00Alt4Pres(dayOfYear,secondOfTheDay,pressure,latLon,AP);
%or
%[altitude,gasTable,t,d]=NRLMSISE00Alt4Pres(dayOfYear,secondOfTheDay,pressure,latLon,AP,F107);
%or
%[altitude,gasTable,t,d]=NRLMSISE00Alt4Pres(dayOfYear,secondOfTheDay,pressure,latLon,AP,F107,F107A);
%
%EXAMPLE:
% dayOfYear=172;
% secondOfTheDay=29000;
% latLon=[60;-70]*(pi/180);
% F107=150;
% F107A=150;
% AP=4;
% pressure=1;%1 Pascal pressure.
% [altitude,gasTable,t,d]=NRLMSISE00Alt4Pres(dayOfYear,secondOfTheDay,pressure,latLon,AP,F107,F107A)
% %One can verify that the altitude is consistent with the standard model:
% latLonAlt=[latLon;altitude];
% [gasTable1,t1,d1]=NRLMSISE00GasTemp(dayOfYear,secondOfTheDay,latLonAlt,AP,F107,F107A)
% %One will see that t1 and d1 match t and d.

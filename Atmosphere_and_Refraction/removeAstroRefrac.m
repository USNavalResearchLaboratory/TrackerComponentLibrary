%%REMOVEASTROREFRAC Remove the effects of refraction in an observed zenith
%                   angle of an object outside the atmosphere using low-
%                   precision atmospheric models for an observer near the
%                   surface of the Earth viewing an object using a
%                   narrowband sensor.
%
%INPUTS: algorithm This specified the algorithm used. The possible values
%                  are:
%                  0: Use a numerical integration method from Chapter 7.2
%                     of [1] and from [2]. This algorithm uses the inputs
%                     plhObs,z0, Rh, P, T, and wl and makes use of the
%                     Sinclair atmospheric model. This algorithm is the
%                     most precise of all of the methods. The acceptable
%                     zenith distances are capped at 100 degrees, which
%                     should be underground. Values above 100 degrees lead
%                     to zTrue and deltaZ being empty matrices.
%                  1: Use the simple formula of [3] for the refraction
%                     experienced by an observer at sea level viewing light
%                     with a wavelength of 0.574 micrometers (yellow). This
%                     algorithm uses the inputs z0, Rh, P, T. This
%                     algorithm is only valid for zenith distances below 70
%                     degrees. For larger values, zTrue and deltaZ are
%                     returned as empty matrices
%                  2: Use the algorithm from the International Astronomical
%                     Union's (IAU) standards of fundamental astronomy
%                     library. This algorithm uses the inputs z0,Rh,P,T,wl
%                     for an observer at sea level. This algorithm will
%                     produce results for all positive zenith distances,
%                     though the results might not be very good for large
%                     values.
%           plhObs The WGS-84 ellipsoidal latitude, longitude and height
%                  of the observer in meters. Only algorithm 0 uses this
%                  parameter, and only the latitude and height above the
%                  reference ellipsoid are used (the longitude does not
%                  matter). The height is treated as an approximate height
%                  above mean sea level. Given the precision of the
%                  algorithm, the fact that geoid undulations are ignored
%                  probably does not matter.For algorithms 1 and 2, an
%                  empty matrix can be passed.
%               z0 A vector or matrix of observed positive zenith
%                  "distances" (in radians) of the refraction-corrupted
%                  celestial object being observed. A zenith distance is
%                  the observed angle of an object down from the
%                  gravitational vertical (the zenith) at the observer's
%                  location. This value is inaccurate as one approaches
%                  pi/2 radians (the horizon). z0 must be greater than
%                  zero. Given the precision of the algorithms that are
%                  available, an angle with respect to the vertical defined
%                  by the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid could probably be
%                  substituted for an angle with respect to the true
%                  gravitational vertical.
%               Rh The relative humidity at the observer (between 0 and 1).
%                  If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%                  passed, then Constants.standardRelHumid is used.
%                P The atmospheric pressure at the observer in Pascals
%                  (N/m^2). If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix
%                  is passed, then Constants.standardAtmosphericPressure is
%                  used.
%                T The air temperature at the observer in degrees Kelvin.
%                  If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%                  passed, then Constants.standardTemp is used.
%               wl The wavelength at which the observation is made in units
%                  of meters. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%                  matrix is passed, then a wavelength of 0.574 micrometers
%                  is used, which is in the visible spectrum (a rather
%                  yellow color).
%
%OUTPUTS: zTrue An NX1 vector of the z0 values in radians with atmospheric
%               refraction removed.
%        deltaZ The refraction correction that was applied. zTrue=z0+deltaZ.
%
%The references for Algorithm 0 are [1] and [2]. Unlike the method given in
%those references, the distance from the center of the Earth to the
%reference ellipsoid at the latitude of the observer is used for the radius
%of the spherical Earth in the model as opposed to a constant for the
%entire Earth, in the model.
%
%Algorithm 1 is described in [2] but also in much more detail in [3]. The
%model requires the partial vapor pressure of water. The low-precision
%conversion from a relative humidity to a partical vapor pressure as is
%used in the algorithm in [2] was used here. The loss in accuracy in using
%a low-precision humidity model should be significantly less than the loss
%of precision in the approximations inherent to the Saastamoinen refraction
%model.
%
%Algorithm 2 is directly taken from the IAU's standards of fundamental
%astronomy library. Specifically, whereas the
%documentation describes the value that must be added to get rid of
%refractive biases as
%DeltaZ=A*tan(z0)+B*tan(z0)^3
%where A and B are obtained using the iauRefco function from the IAU's
%library, the implentation used in the function iauAtioq uses a slightly
%modified formula so that reasonable values are obtained for zenith angles
%at or above 90 degrees. Thus, the formula for the correction is copied
%from software version 10 of the function iauAtioq in the IAU's library.
%The documentation for the library lists the accuracy compared to a
%more sophisticated ray tracing method as being  60 milliarcseconds (mas)
%at the worst case in the visible region to 300 mas in the radio region
%(wavelengths greater than 1mm). In both cases, the maximum zenith distance
%(zetaObs) considered was 75 degrees.
%
%Algorithm 2 will provide results without errors and without producing NaNs
%for all input values. The other techniques will produce errors.

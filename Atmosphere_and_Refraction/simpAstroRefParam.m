function [A,B]=simpAstroRefParam(R,P,T,wl) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%SIMPASTROREFPARAM Obtain the parameters A and B for a very simple
%                    astronomical refraction model of the form:
%                    DeltaZ=A*tan(zetaObs)+B*tan(zetaObs)^3, where zetasObs
%                    is the observed zenith angle of a celestial body and
%                    DeltaZ is the bias due to refraction that should be
%                    subtracted from zetaObs to get the true direction of
%                    arrival. Such a model is invalid for observed zenith
%                    angles near 90 degrees. However, the function
%                    simpAstroRefrac, which uses these constants, uses a
%                    modified formula that is more robust.
%
%INPUTS: R The relative humidity at the observer (between 0 and 1). If
%          this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
%          Constants.standardRelHumid is used.
%        P The atmospheric pressure at the observer in Pascals (N/m^2). If
%          this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
%          Constants.standardAtmosphericPressure is used.
%        T The air temperature at the observer in degrees Kelvin. If this
%          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
%          Constants.standardTemp is used.
%       wl The wavelength at which the observation is made in units of
%          meters. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then a wavelength of 0.574 micrometers is used, which
%          is in the visible spectrum (a rather yellow color).
%
%OUTPUTS: A The A value for the model in radians.
%         B The B value for the model in radians.

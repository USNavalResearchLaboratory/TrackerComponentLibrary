function p=dewPointPres4Temp(T,algChoice)
%%DEWPOINTPRES4TEMP Obtain the saturation pressure of water for a given
%                   temperature. This is the partial vapor pressure of
%                   water that (in equilibrium) can not be exceeded. In
%                   other words, this is the dew point pressure. Above this
%                   pressure, water would begin to come out of gaseous form
%                   at this temperature to restore equilibrium.
%
%INPUTS: T A vector or matrix of temperatures in degrees Kelvin.
% algChoice An optional parameter specifying the algorithm to use. The
%          choices are
%          0 The corrected version of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for
%            use over land or in the upper air.
%          1 The empirical Magnus-type equation for use over water or in
%            the upper air (-40C to 50C temperature).
%          2 The empirical Magnus-type equation for use over ice (-80C to
%            0C temperature)
%          If algChoice is omitted, then the default value of 0, the
%          corrected Clausius-Clapeyron equation of [1,2,3] is used.
%          Choices 1 and 2 use the methods from [4].
%
%OUTPUTS: p The dew point pressure in units of Newtons per square meter
%           (Pascals) corresponding to each of the temperatures in T.
%
%Formulae 0 is from [1], where formula 1 is also mentioned.
%Two minor comments were printed on that paper, specifically [2] and [3].
%
%The paper demonstrates how the traditional form of the frequently used
%Clausius-Clapeyron equation for finding the saturation of pressure of air
%is based on the incorrect assumption that the latent heat of vaporization
%(also known as the anthalpy of vaporization) of water is constant as a
%function of temperature. This assumption leads to inconsistent results.
%The paper derives a more accurate form of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation
%by relaxing that assumption. The corrected version of the Clausius-
%Clapeyron equation is shown to be more accurate than the empirical Magnus-
%type equation (algorithm 1). Note that by switching the constants, the
%corrected Clausius-Clapeyron equation can be used to find the saturation
%pressure of other substances, such as acetone.
%
%The Magnus-type equations are from [4]. Note that an additional pressure-
%dependent Magnus type equation to deal with departures from the ideal gas
%law is also presented in that paper, but is not provided here.
%
%Note that the function dewPointTemp4Pres is the inverse of this function.

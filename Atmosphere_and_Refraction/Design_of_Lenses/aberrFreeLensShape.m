function [xb,yb,zb,za]=aberrFreeLensShape(zaFun,xa,ya,n,T,fa,fb)
%%ABERRFREELENSSHAPE Given the shape of one side of a singlet lens,
%          determine the shape of the other side so as to be able to focus
%          light from a given source to a specified point without spherical
%          aberration.
%
%INPUTS: zaFun A handle to a function that takes the two independent
%              parameters, xa and ya, and returns the height of the left
%              side of the lens and the derivative of the height with
%              respect to each of the independent parameters.The function
%              handle is called as [za,dzadx,dzady]=zaFun(xa,ya) and it is
%              required that za=0 for xa=0, ya=0. It is assumed that xa and
%              ya can be same-sized matrix arguments resulting in za,
%              dzadx, and dzady being matrix arguments of the same size.
%        xa,ya A grid of points on parameterizing locations on the given
%              surface of the lens (they can go into zaFun). These matrices
%              must have the same shape.
%            n The index of refraction of the lends. The lens is assumed to
%              have a constant index of refraction and the surrounding
%              medium is assumed to have an index of refraction of 1. Thus,
%              if the surrounding medium does not have an index of
%              refraction of 1, then n should be the relative index of
%              refraction with respect to the medium.
%            T The thickness of the lens at xa=0,ya=0.
%           fa The object is located at (xa=0,,ya=0,fa), so fa is the
%              location of the object from one side of the lens. fa is
%              typically negative.
%           fb The location of the image focal point is (xa=0,ya=0,,T+fb),
%              so fb is the distance from the side of the lens opposite
%              from which fa is measured, to the image. Typically, fb is
%              positive.
%
%OUTPUTS: xb,yb,zb Points on the other side of the lens. These matrices
%                  have the same shape as xa and ya. These can eb used to
%                  plot a surface.
%               za The values returned by zaFun when given xa and ya.

%This function implements the explicit solution of [1]. Note that the
%expression for h in Equation 8b appears to be incorrect. Rather, the
%expression used in Appendix A is used in its place.

function [rb,zb,ra,za,hb,tb]=aberrFreeRadSymLens4Surf(zaFun,hbFun,tbFun,rSpan,n,t,ta,numPoints)
%%ABERRFREERADSYMLENS4SURF Given the shape of one side of a radially-
%          symmetric singlet lens, determine the shape of the other side so
%          as to be able to focus light from a given source to a specified
%          distant surface without spherical aberration. The radial
%          symmetry means that one only needs to consider the shape of a
%          single 2D slice through the center of the lens (and the surface,
%          because the rest of the lens and surface in 3D are given by
%          rotating the slice about an axis coming out of the center of the
%          lens. Geometric optics is assumed.
%
%INPUTS: zaFun A handle to a function that takes the independent parameter
%              (which spans the width of the lens) and returns the height
%              of the left side of the lens and the derivative of the
%              height with respect to the independent parameter. The
%              function handle is called as [za,dza]=zaFun(ra) and it is
%              required that za=0 and dza=0 for ra=0. It is assumed that ra
%              can be a vector argument resulting in za and dza being
%              vector arguments.
%  hbFun,tbFun These functions handles are called as hb=hfFun(ra), and
%              tb=tbFun(ra). The points (hb,tb) are on the surface onto
%              which one wishes to project from the lens, without
%              aberration.
%        rSpan A 2X1 or 1X2 vector giving the span of the values of ra that
%              are to go into zaFun. If a scalar is passed, then rSpan is
%              replaced with [-rSpan,rSpan]. This has the same units (e.g.
%              mm) as za, t, ta, hb, and tb as well as the output
%              parameters.
%            n The index of refraction of the lends. The lens is assumed to
%              have a constant index of refraction and the surrounding
%              medium is assumed to have an index of refraction of 1. Thus,
%              if the surrounding medium does not have an index of
%              refraction of 1, then n should be the relative index of
%              refraction with respect to the medium. n can be negative but
%              not zero.
%            t The thickness of the lens at ra=0; t>0. 
%           ta The object is located at (ra=0,ta), so ta is the location of
%              the object from one side of the lens. ta is typically
%              negative.
%    numPoints The number of points within the span of rSpan over which the
%              surface of the lens are determined. The default if omitted
%              or an empty matrix is passed is 500.
%
%OUTPUTS: rb,zb These are 1XnumPoints vectors giving the Cartesian
%               locations of points of the side of the lens that was
%               computed by this function.
%         ra,za These are the coordinates of the side of the lens specified
%               by zaFun.
%         hb,tb These are the coordinates of the surface specified by hbFun
%               and tbFun.
%
%This function implements the explicit solution of [1]. Note that the
%algorithm in the paper requires the choice of a sign parameter s1. This
%parameter is chosen to be the solution that gives the thickness t at ra=0.
%
%Note that physically irrealizable systems might produce lends deisgns with
%surfaces that intersect themselves.

%%ABERRFREERADSYMLENSSHAPE Given the shape of one side of a radially-
%          symmetric singlet lens, determine the shape of the other side so
%          as to be able to focus light from a given source to a specified
%          point without spherical aberration. The radial symmetry means
%          that one only needs to consider the shape of a single 2D slice
%          through the center of the lens, because the rest of the lens in
%          3D is given by rotating the slice about an axis coming out of
%          the center of the lens. Geometric optics is assumed.
%
%INPUTS: zaFun A handle to a function that takes the independent parameter
%              (which spans the width of the lens) and returns the height
%              of the left side of the lens and the derivative of the
%              height with respect to the independent parameter. The
%              function handle is called as [za,dza]=zaFun(ra) and it is
%              required that za=0 and dza=0 for ra=0. It is assumed that ra
%              can be a vector argument resulting in za and dza being
%              vector arguments.
%        rSpan A 2X1 or 1X2 vector giving the span of the values of ra that
%              are to go into zaFun. If a scalar is passed, then rSpan is
%              replaced with [-rSpan,rSpan]. This has the same units (e.g.
%              mm) as za, t, ta, and tb as well as the output parameters.
%            n The index of refraction of the lends. The lens is assumed to
%              have a constant index of refraction and the surrounding
%              medium is assumed to have an index of refraction of 1. Thus,
%              if the surrounding medium does not have an index of
%              refraction of 1, then n should be the relative index of
%              refraction with respect to the medium. n can be negative but
%              not zero.
%            t The thickness of the lens at ra=0; t>0. 
%           ta The object is located at (ra=0,ta), so ta is the location of
%              the object from one side of the lens. ta is typically
%              negative.
%           tb The location of the image focal point is (ra=0,t+tb), so tb
%              is the distance from the side of the lens opposite from
%              which ta is measured, to the image. Typically, tb is
%              positive.
%    numPoints The number of points within the span of rSpan over which the
%              surface of the lens are determined. The default if omitted
%              or an empty matrix is passed is 500.
%
%OUTPUTS: rb,zb These are 1XnumPoints vectors giving the Cartesian
%               locations of points of the side of the lens that was
%               computed by this function.
%         ra,za These are the coordinates of the side of the lens specified
%               by zaFun.
%
%This function implements the explicit solution of [1]. Note that the
%algorithm in the paper requires the choice of a sign parameter s1. This
%parameter is chosen to be the solution that gives the thickness t at ra=0.
%
%It is possible that rSpan is chosen to be so large that it exceeds the
%region over which a physical lens is possible. In such an instance, the
%lines for the top and bottom of the lens cross. Another unrealisable lens
%possibility arises when the surface for one side intersects itself. Often,
%that problem can be fixed by changing the index of refraction of the
%glass.

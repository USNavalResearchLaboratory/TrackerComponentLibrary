%%REDUCESTDREFRAC2SPHER Given a measurement of the atmospheric refractivity
%                       at a particular height above sea level, determine
%                       the equivalent refractivity at sea level using  a
%                       standard exponential atmospheric model. The
%                       algorithm can handle sea surface refractivities
%                       from 200 to 450. 
%
%INPUTS: NMeas The measured atmospheric refractivity. Note that the
%              refractivity is (n-1)*1e6, where n is the index of
%              refraction.
%       height The height in meters at which the measurement of NMeas was
%              taken. One would expect this to be an orthometic height
%              (with respect to mean sea level). However, the model is low
%              fidelity, so using a height with respect to the Earth's
%              reference ellipsoid would presumably not introduce a
%              significant amount of error.
%  expConst, multConst The two optional, positive  parameters
%              parameterizing the decay constant in the model. Assume that
%              at a point, the refractivity is N. Increasing the height by
%              1km, the model is that the refractivity changes by
%              deltaN=-multConst*exp(expConst*N). deltaN cannot be
%              negative. If these parameters are omitted or empty matrices
%              are passed, then the values fitting the data in [1] are
%              used: expConst=0.005577 and multConst=7.32. Note that the
%              value ce=log(Ns/(Ns+DeltaN))/1000 is the decay constant in
%              inverse meters.
%     varargin Parameters to pass to the fminbnd function. These are
%              standard comma-separated keys and values, such as
%              'TolX',1e-8.
%
%OUTPUTS: Ns The indices of refraction reduced to sea level under a
%            standard exponential atmospheric model. There can be 1-2
%            solutions.
%
%The standard exponential atmospheric model is derived in [1]. This
%function determines the refractivity at the given altitudes for sea
%surface refractivities from 200 to 450 and subtracts the observed
%refractivity. Any zero crossings indicate potential solutions. The
%function fminbnd is then used to find each of the zeros given bounded
%regions for the zero crossings.
%
%The use of this type of very basic refraction model is discussed in [2].

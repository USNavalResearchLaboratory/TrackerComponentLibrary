function [z,uTx,uTarRx,uTarTx]=Cart2RuvStdRefrac(zC,useHalfRange,zTx,zRx,M,Ns,includeW,ce,rE,spherCent)
%%CART2RUVSTDREFRAC Convert points in Cartesian coordinates (either the
%         global system or a local system at the receiver) into local
%         bistatic r-u-v coordinates of the receiver, accounting for how a
%         standard exponential atmospheric model warps the measurements.
%         r-u-v coordinates consist of a bistatic range and direction
%         cosines at the receiver. The "direction cosines" u and v are just
%         the x and y coordinates of a unit vector from the receiver to
%         the target in the coordinate system at the receiver (Here, to the
%         refraction-corrupted apparent direction). This basically assumes
%         that the boresight direction of the receiver is the z axis.
%         Assuming the target is in front of the receiver, the third unit
%         vector coordinate is not needed. However, with the includeW
%         option, it can be provided, resulting in r-u-v-w coordinates. This
%         function is not suitable for computing refraction between
%         satellites, grazing the Earth's atmosphere. The algorithm might
%         have an error if the ray path goes too far underground.
%
%INPUT: zC  A 3XN matrix of Cartesian points (target locations) in global
%           [x;y;z] Cartesian coordinates.
% useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
%           should be divided by two. This normally comes up when operating
%           in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is a one-way
%           range. The default if this parameter is not provided (or an
%           empty matrix is provided) is false.
%       zTx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the transmitter in global
%           Cartesian coordinates.  If this parameter is omitted or an
%           empty matrix is passed, then the receiver is placed at the origin.
%       zRx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the receiver in global
%           Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%           matrix is passed, then the receiver is placed at the origin.
%         M A 3X3 rotation matrix to go from the alignment of the global
%           coordinate system to the local alignment of the receiver. The z
%           vector of the local coordinate system of the receiver is the
%           pointing direction of the receiver. If this matrix is omitted,
%           then the identity matrix is used.
%        Ns The atmospheric refractivity reduced to the reference sphere.
%           Note that the refractivity is (n-1)*1e6, where n is the index
%           of refraction. The function reduceStdRefrac2Spher can be used
%           to reduce a refractivity to the surface of a reference
%           ellipsoid. This function does not allow different
%           refractivities to be used as the transmitter and receiver. If
%           this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, a
%           default value of 313 is used.
%  includeW An optional boolean value indicating whether a third direction
%           cosine component should be included. The u and v direction
%           cosines are two parts of a 3D unit vector. Generally, one might
%           assume that the target is in front of the sensor, so the third
%           component would be positive and is not needed. However, the
%           third component can be included if ambiguity exists. The
%           default if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%           passed is false.
%        ce The optional decay constant of the exponential model. The
%           refractivity N at height h is N=Ns*exp(-ce*(h-h0)) where h0 is
%           the reference height (in this function, the height of the
%           reference ellipsoid surface is used). ce is related to the
%           change in refractivity at an elevation of 1km based on the
%           refractivity at sea level as
%           ce=log(Ns/(Ns+DeltaN))/1000;%Units of inverse meters.
%           where the change in refractivity for a change in elevation of
%           1km is DeltaN=-multConst*exp(expConst*Ns); In [1], standard
%           values for the two constants are expConst=0.005577; and
%           multConst=7.32; If ce is omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%           the value based on the standard model is used.
% rE,spherCent The radius of the Earth to use for the spherical Earth
%           approximation used in the model and also the offset between the
%           global model and the local spherical model. It is assumed that
%           zC,zTx,and zRx are all given in the global model and will need
%           to be transformed to the local model to the used. If rE is
%           omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then the default of
%           [rE,spherCent]=osculatingSpher4LatLon(Cart2Ellipse(zRx)) is
%           used. The defaults here mean that a WGS-84 reference ellipsoid
%           is approximated by the local osculating sphere.
%
%OUTPUTS: z The 3XN (or 4XN if includeW is true) matrix of location vectors
%           of the points in bistatic [r;u;v] coordinates. If
%           useHalfRange=true, then the r component is half the bistatic
%           range (half the round-trip range for a monostatic scenario).
%       uTx A 3XN set of unit vectors pointing from the transmitter to the
%           refraction-corrupted position (of the target as seen by the
%           transmitter. This is in the global coordinate system.
%    uTarRx A 3XN set of unit vectors pointing from the target to the
%           refraction-corrupted position of the receiver as seen by the
%           target. This is in the global coordinate system.
%    uTarTx A 3XN set of unit vectors pointing from the target to the
%           refraction-corrupted position of the transmitter as seen by the
%           target. This is in the global coordinate system.
%
%This function implements the refraction algorithm for the basic
%exponential atmosphere as described in [1] for the bistatic case. If the
%target is collocated with the transmitter or the receiver, then NaNs will
%be returned for some values. The basic exponential refraction model is in
%[2].
%
%The model is parameterized in terms of a height above a sphere. The Earth
%is more of an ellipsoid than a sphere. Thus, we use local spherical
%approximations about the transmitter and the receiver. That is, for
%computing the refraction from the transmitter to the target, we use the
%distance from the center of the Earth to the surface of the reference
%ellipsoid at the transmitter as the radius of an approximately spherical
%Earth. Similarly, the distance from the center of the Earth to the
%receiver is used in the approximation for the path from the target to the
%receiver.
%
%The algorithm in [1] performs ray tracing by solving a boundary value
%problem. here, the bvp5c function in Matlab is used to solve the problem.
%
%For paths that are nearly vertical, it is approximated that there is no
%bending in angle and an explicit solution to the integral over the index
%of refraction in the vertical direction is used to obtain the range.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we have two radars and one target near Hawaii.
% latLonRx=deg2rad([20.269202;-155.852051]);
% AltRx=0;
% latLonTx=deg2rad([20.724568;-155.978394]);

% zTx=ellips2Cart([latLonTx;AltTx]);

% %The receiver faces 45 degrees East of North and 15 degrees up from the

%%ATMOSREFRACMEAS  Given the location of an observer and an object in the

%                  arrival of a signal from the object to the observer,
%                  accounting for basic,standard  refraction. A
%                  low-fidelity exponential atmospheric model is used. This
%                  function is not suitable for computing refraction

%We need the conversion from the 3D coordinate system of the observer and

%vector common to both coordinate systems in the local up vector, which
%will be the local y axis. The second vector common to both will be the
%local x vector, which will be the projection of xObj-xObs onto the local
%tangent plane. Here, the vertical is the spherical model vertical. Since
%the precision of the model is low enough that the difference between the

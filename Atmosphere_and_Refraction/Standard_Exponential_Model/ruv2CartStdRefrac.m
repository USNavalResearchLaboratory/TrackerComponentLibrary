function zCart=ruv2CartStdRefrac(zRUVBiased,useHalfRange,zTx,zRx,M,Ns,ce,rE,spherCent,xMax)
%%RUV2CARTSTDREFRAC Convert points in refraction-corrupted bistatic r-u-v
%         (or r-u-v-w) coordinates into Cartesian coordinates using a
%         standard exponential atmospheric model.  If r-u-v coordinates are
%         used, the target is assumed to be in front of the receiver (local
%         z coordinate is positive). r-u-v coordinates consist of a
%         bistatic range and direction cosines at the receiver. The
%         "direction cosines" u and v are just the x and y coordinates of a
%         unit vector from the receiver to the target in the coordinate
%         system at the receiver. This basically assumes that the boresight
%         direction of the receiver is the z axis. Assuming the target is
%         in front of the receiver, the third unit vector coordinate is not
%         needed. However, r-u-v-w coordinates include the third component.
%         For monostatic coordinate conversion where the range is a one-way
%         range, set useHalfRange=true and zTx and zRx to the same value.
%         This function is not suitable for computing refraction between
%         satellites, grazing the Earth's atmosphere. The algorithm might
%         have an error if the ray path goes too far underground.
%
%INPUTS: z A 3XN matrix of refraction-corrupted measurements with elements
%          [r;u;v], where r is the bistatic range from the transmitter to
%          the target to the receiver, and u and v are direction cosines.
%          Each u,v pair should have a magnitude less than or equal to
%          one. If the magnitude is greater than one, then the pair is
%          normalized before conversion to avoid imaginary results.
%          Alternatively, one can pass a 4XN matrix of [r;u;v;w] vectors
%          where [u;v;w] form a full unit vector in the receiver's local
%          3D Cartesian coordinates.
% useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
%          should be divided by two. This normally comes up when operating
%          in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is a one-way
%          range. The default if this parameter is not provided (or an
%          empty matrix is provided) is false.
%      zTx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the transmitter in global
%          Cartesian coordinates.  If this parameter is omitted or an
%          empty matrix is passed, then the receiver is placed at the origin.
%      zRx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the receiver in global
%          Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passed, then the receiver is placed at the origin.
%        M A 3X3 rotation matrix to go from the alignment of the global
%          coordinate system to the local alignment fo the receiver. The z
%          vector of the local coordinate system of the receiver is the
%          pointing direction of the receiver. If this matrix is omitted,
%          then the identity matrix is used.
%       Ns The atmospheric refractivity reduced to the reference sphere.
%          Note that the refractivity is (n-1)*1e6, where n is the index of
%          refraction. The function reduceStdRefrac2Spher can be used to
%          reduce a refractivity to the surface of a reference ellipsoid.
%          This function does not allow different refractivities to be
%          used as the transmitter and receiver. If this parameter is
%          omitted or an empty matrix is passed, a default value of 313 is
%          used.
%       ce The optional decay constant of the exponential model. The
%          refractivity N at height h is N=Ns*exp(-ce*(h-h0)) where h0 is
%          the reference height (in this function, the height of the
%          reference ellipsoid surface is used). ce is related to the
%          change in refractivity at an elevation of 1km based on the
%          refractivity at sea level as
%          ce=log(Ns/(Ns+DeltaN))/1000;%Units of inverse meters.
%          where the change in refractivity for a change in elevation of
%          1km is DeltaN=-multConst*exp(expConst*Ns); In [1], standard
%          values for the two constants are expConst=0.005577; and
%          multConst=7.32; If ce is omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%          the value based on the standard model is used.
% rE,spherCent The radius of the Earth to use for the spherical Earth
%           approximation used in the model and also the offset between the
%           global model and the local spherical model. It is assumed that
%           zC,zTx,and zRx are all given in the global model and will need
%           to be transformed to the local model to the used. If rE is
%           omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then the default of
%           [rE,spherCent]=osculatingSpher4LatLon(Cart2Ellipse(zRx)) is
%           used. The defaults here mean that a WGS-84 reference ellipsoid
%           is approximated by the local osculating sphere.
%     xMax This function traces the ray to a maximum displacement in the
%          local tangent plane prior (or vertically for nearly vertical
%          directions) to attempting to find a particular range. This is an
%          optional parameter specifying the maximum distance to trace the
%          ray. The default if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix
%          is passed is 1000e3 (1000km).
%
%This function implements the algorithm of [1]. If the target is collocated
%with the transmitter or the receiver, then the algorithm will fail. The
%basic exponential refraction model is in [2].
%
%The model is parameterized in terms of a height above a sphere. The Earth
%is more of an ellipsoid than a sphere. Thus, we use local spherical
%approximations about the transmitter and the receiver. That is, for
%computing the refraction from the transmitter to the target, we use the
%distance from the center of the Earth to the surface of the reference
%ellipsoid at the transmitter as the radius of an approximately spherical
%Earth. Similarly, the distance from the center of the Earth to the
%receiver is used in the approximation for the path from the target to the
%receiver.
%
%The algorithm of [1] performs ray tracing by solving an initial value
%problem and performing a line search.
%
%For paths that are nearly vertical, it is approximated that there is no
%bending in angle and an explicit solution to the integral over the index
%of refraction in the vertical direction is used to obtain the range offset
%in the vertical direction.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%In an example near Hawaii, we will convert a position into bistatic r-u-v
%coordinates using Cart2RuvStdRefrac and then we will convert it back using
%this function.

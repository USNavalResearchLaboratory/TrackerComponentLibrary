function val=erfComplex(z)
%%ERFCOMPLEX Evaluate the error function in a manner valid for complex
%            arguemnts. Matlab's built-in function erf cannot handle
%            complex arguments. The error function is defined as
%            (2/pi)*integral_0^z exp(-t^2) dt.
%
%INPUTS: z A scalar, vector, or matrix of values at which one wishes to
%          evaluate the error function.
%
%OUTPUTS: val A matrix having the same dimensions as z in which the values
%             of the scaled error function are computed for the values in
%             z.
%
%For values of abs(z)<0.08, six terms of the Maclaurin series in [1] are
%used. These should be sufficient for convergence. For larger values, the
%Faddeeva function is used through the relation 
%erf(z)=1-exp(-z^2)*Faddeeva(1i*z);

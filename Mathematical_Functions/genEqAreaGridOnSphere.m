function xyz=genEqAreaGridOnSphere(n,algorithm)
%%GENEQAREAGRIDONSPHERE Generate a grid of Cartesian points on the surface
%                       of a unit sphere based on equal-area projections.
%
%INPUTS: n This determines the number of points to generate. For
%          algorithm=0, exectly n*n points will be generated. For n=1,
%          approximately n*n points will be generated,
% algorithm This selects the algorithm to use. Possible values are:
%          0 Use Lambert's azimuthal projection for the entire sphere. This
%            leads to points being increasingly distorted near the North
%            pole.
%          1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use
%            Lambert's azimuthal projection for each hemisphere.
%
%OUTPUTS: xyz A 3XnumPts matrix of the generated points.
%
%The algorithms of Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of [1] are used.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% n=20;
% pts=genEqAreaGridOnSphere(n);
% size(pts)
% figure(1)
% clf
% scatter3(pts(1,:),pts(2,:),pts(3,:),'.')

function lambda=ChebyshevI2IIMoments(moments)
%%CHEBYSHEVI2IIMOMENTS Let moments hold values of the integrals
%           int_{-1}^1 T_r(x) f(x) dx for some value x and for r=0:n, where
%           T_n(x) is the nth order Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
%           This function converts the moments into those from the integral
%           int_{-1}^1 U_r(x) f(x) dx, where U_n(x) is the nth order
%           Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
%
%INPUTS: moments A 1X(n+1) or (n+1)X1 vector of moments of f(x) with
%                respect to Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind from
%                order 0 to n.
%
%OUTPUTS: lambda A(n+1)X1 vector of moments of f(x) with respect to
%                Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind.
%
%The conversion is given in remark 1 in Section 3 of [1].

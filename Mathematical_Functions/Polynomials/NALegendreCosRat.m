function [PBarUVals,dPBarUValsdTheta,d2PBarUValsdTheta2]=NALegendreCosRat(theta,M,scalFactor)
%NALEGENDRECOSRAT Evaluate \bar{P}_{nm}(cos(theta))/u^m for all n from
%                 0 to M and for each n for all m from 0 to n, where
%                 u=abs(sin(theta)). \bar{P}_{nm}(x) is the fully
%                 normalized associated Legendre function of x of degree n
%                 and order m. Also evaluate
%                 D{\bar{P}_{nm}(cos(theta))}/u^m and
%                 D2{\bar{P}_{nm}(cos(theta))}/u^m where D{} is the first
%                 derivative operator with respect to theta and D2{} is the
%                 second derivative operator with respect to theta. All of
%                 the values can be scaled by a factor of scalFac, if
%                 desired, to help prevent overflows with high degrees and
%                 orders.
%
%INPUTS: theta An angle in radians.
%       maxDeg The maximum degree and order of the output. This must be
%              >=0.
%   scalFactor A scale factor to help prevent overflow of the results. In
%              [1], discussed below, a value of 10^(-280) is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: PBarUVals An instance of the CountingClusterSet class such that
%                   PBarUVals(n+1,m+1)=scalFac*\bar{P}_{nm}(cos(theta))/u^m.
%  dPBarUValsdTheta An instance of the CountingClusterSet class such that
%                   dPBarUValsdTheta(n+1,m+1)=scalFac*D{\bar{P}_{nm}(cos(theta))}/u^m
% d2PBarUValsdTheta2 An instance of the CountingClusterSet class such that
%                   d2PBarUValsdTheta2(n+1,m+1)=scalFac*D2{\bar{P}_{nm}(cos(theta))}/u^m
%
%The modified forward row (MFR) algorithm of [1] is used to compute
%PBarUVals and dPBarUValsdTheta. For d2PBarUValsdTheta2, the algorithm of
%[2] is used. However, the paper contains a typo. The first term of the
%first unnumbered equation should be multiplied by an additional (1/u).
%This function uses the correct formulation, which is also described in
%Appendix F of [3].
%
%With the notation P^m_n(x) for an associated Legendre function of degree n
%and order m evaluated at the point x, one generally means 
%P^m_n(x)=(-1)^m*(1-x^)^(m/2)*D_m{P_n(x)}
%where P_n(x) is a Legendre polynomial of degree n evaluated at x and
%D_m{P_n(x)} is the mth derivative of the polynomial. These associated
%Legendre functions are the same as those used in the International
%Geomagnetic Reference Field. On the other hand, with the notation
%P_{nm}(x), one generally means (-1)^mP^m_n(x). This notation is also
%called an associated Legendre function. Matlab's built-in function
%legendre(n,x) returns all P^m_n(x) for m=0 to m=n. On the other hand, the
%notation \bar{P}_{nm}(x), refers to a fully normalized associated Legendre
%function. Multiple definitions of what is normalized exist. In this
%function, the normalization is such that
%\bar{P}_{nm}(x)=P_{nm}(x)*sqrt(k*(2*n+1)*factorial(n-m)/factorial(n+m))
%where k=1 if m=0 and k=2 otherwise. This differs from the normalization
%constant that Matlab uses in the normalized version of its built-in
%associated Legendre function. It is the same as the normalization 
%constant the NGA uses in its coefficients for the EGM96 and the
%EGM2008 gravitation models.
%
%The fully normalized associated Legendre function ratios that this
%function computes can be used in the synthesis of spherical harmonic
%coefficients.

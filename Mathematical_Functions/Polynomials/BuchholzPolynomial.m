function p=BuchholzPolynomial(n,b,z)
%%BUCHHOLZPOLYNOMIAL Compute the value of a Buchholz polynomial of a given
%             order with the specified parameters. The Buchholz polynomial
%             p_n(b,z) arises when dealing with hypergeometric functions as
%             in [1].
%
%INPUTS: n The order of the polynomial. This is a non-negative integer.
%        b A number. This can be complex.
%        z A number. This can be complex.
%
%OUTPUTS: p The value of the Buchhols polynomial with the specified
%           parameters.
%
%The polynomials are implemented using Equations 5, 6, and 7 of [1].

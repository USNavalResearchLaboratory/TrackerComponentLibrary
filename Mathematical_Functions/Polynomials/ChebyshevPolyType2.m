function U=ChebyshevPolyType2(tau,n,tauStart,tauEnd)
%%CHEBYSHEVPOLYTYPE2 Evaluate Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind from
%               order 0 to n order at a given point tau.
%
%INPUTS: tau An NX1 or 1XN vector of values from tauStart to tauEnd, or
%            from -1 to 1 if tauStart and tauEnd are omitted, where one
%            wishes to evaluate the Chebyshev polynomials of the second
%            kind.
%          n The non-negative integer maximum order of the Chebyshev
%            polynomials evaluated.
% tauStart,tauEnd The possible range of the inputs. Given this range, the
%            actual input to the polynomials is scaled to
%            tau=(tau-0.5*(tauStart+tauEnd))/(0.5*(tauEnd-tauStart));
%            If omitted, a range of -1 to 1 is assumed --the normal range
%            for Chebyshev polynomials.
%
%OUTPUTS: T An (n+1)XN matrix of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second
%           kind from order 0 to n evaluated at each of the values of tau.
%           U(i,j) is the (i-1)th order Chebyshev polynomial evaluated at
%           tau(j).
%
%In remark 1 in Section 3 of [1], a formula to convert from Chebyshev
%polynomials of type I to type II is given. That is implemented here and
%the ChebyshevPoly function is called to get Chebyshev polynomials of type
%I.

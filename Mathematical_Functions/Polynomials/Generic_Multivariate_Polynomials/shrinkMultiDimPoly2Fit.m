function coeffsRet=shrinkMultiDimPoly2Fit(coeffs)
%%SHRINKMULTIDIMPOLY2FIT Given a hypermatrix of coefficients of a
%                  multivariate polynomial, many of which might be zero,
%                  return the smallest hypermatrix possible that can
%                  represent the polynomial. This function effectively gets
%                  rid of high-order terms that are all zero.
%
%INPUTS: coeffs A hypermatrix of the coefficients for the multivariate
%               polynomial. These are arranged such that
%               coeffs(a1,a2,a3...an) corresponds to the coefficient of an
%               x1^(a1-1)*x2^(a2-1)*x3^(a3-1)...xn^(an-1) term.  Thus, the
%               number of indices coeffs takes is equal to the
%               dimensionality of x (not counting singleton dimensions at
%               the end of coeffs). Note that this ordering is the reverse
%               that used in the 1D polyval function that is built into
%               Matlab. The number of elements for each index in coeffs is
%               the maximum order of that dimension +1.
%
%OUTPUTS: coeffsRet The same multivariate polynomial as represented by
%               coeffs, but shrunk as small as possible.
%
%As an example, consider a 2D polynomial:
%440-288*x2+60*x2^2-4*x2^3-110*x1+72*x1*x2-15*x1*x2^2+x1*x2^3
% coeffs=zeros(5,5);
% coeffs(0+1,0+1)=440;
% coeffs(0+1,1+1)=-288;
% coeffs(0+1,2+1)=60;
% coeffs(0+1,3+1)=-4;
% coeffs(1+1,0+1)=-110;
% coeffs(1+1,1+1)=72;
% coeffs(1+1,2+1)=-15;
% coeffs(1+1,3+1)=1;
% coeffsRet=shrinkMultiDimPoly2Fit(coeffs)
%One will find that coeffsRet is only 2X4 in size, versus the 5X5 for the
%original matrix. Both represent the same 2D polynomial.

function maxBound=numPolySolBoundBezout(termMats,method)
%%NUMPOLYSOLBOUNDBEZOUT Compute an upper bound on the number of solutions
%            to a system of n polynomial equations in n unknowns using one
%            of two types of Bezout bounds. Note that the bounds only
%            applies to systems that have a finite number of solutions
%            (non-degenerate systems).
%
%INPUTS: termMats  A cell array of matrices of terms of the polynomials.
%           Each term matrix is an (n+1)XnumTerms matrix such that
%           termMat(:,i)=[c,a1,a2,...,an] is a monomial term where c is the
%           value of of the monomial coefficient and the monomial is
%           x1^(a1-1)*x2^(a2-1)*x3^(a3-1)...xn^(an-1). For n variables,
%           there must be n term matrices. If in an equation only the first
%           nEq<n variables are used, then the term matrices still should
%           have space for the other coefficients, which are all set to
%           zero degree (as in the example below).
%       method An optional parameter indicating the method to use to
%           determine the upper bound. Possible values are:
%           0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed).
%             Compute the bound from Bezout's theorem. That is, compute the
%             total degree of the polynomials. This upper bound is equal to
%             the number of solutions of a homogenized system, but
%             generally greatly overestimates the number of solutions of
%             more common sparse systems. This bound is easy to compute.
%           1 Compute the multihomogenerous Bezout bound using brute force
%             to find the optiomal partition. This is significantly more
%             computationally intensive than 0. However, it is also
%             significantly better.
%           2 Compute an approximate multihomogeneous Bezout bound using a
%             method similar to that described in Section 3.4.2 of [1].
%
%OUTPUTS: maxBound The upper bound on the maximum number of solutions of
%                  the polynomial system.
%
%The bounds are described in Chapter 3 of [1]. Method 2 is similar to the
%heuristic algorithm in Section 3.4.3 of [1]. However, the description in
%[1] is inconsistent. Rather than going through all popssible partitions
%for finding the one that produces the minimum permanent of the degree
%matrix, as in the true multihomogenous Bezout bound, this function starts
%with everything in one partition and goes through the variables
%sequentially. A variable is either kept in the initial partition, moved
%to its own partition or put in another partition, depending on which has
%the least cost. This is a greedy algorithm.
%
%Though there may exist more efficient methods of computing the
%multihomogenous Bezout bound, it is shown in [2] that the multihomogeneous
%Bezout bound cannot be computed in polynomial time unlesss P=NP.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%The example here is that used in [1]. We have a system of eight equations.
%(Implicitly, this means all of these equations=0).
% termMats=cell(8,1);
% theEq='x1^2+x2^2-1';
% termMats{1}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='x3^2+x4^2-1';
% termMats{2}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='x5^2+x6^2-1';
% termMats{3}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='x7^2+x8^2-1';
% termMats{4}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='0.004731*x1*x3-0.3578*x2*x3-0.1238*x1-0.001637*x2-0.9338*x4+x7-0.3571';
% termMats{5}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='0.2238*x1*x3+0.7623*x2*x3+0.2638*x1-0.07745*x2-0.6734*x4-0.6022';
% termMats{6}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='x6*x8+0.3578*x1+0.004731*x2';
% termMats{7}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='-0.7623*x1+0.2238*x2+0.3461';
% termMats{8}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% maxBound=numPolySolBoundBezout(termMats,0)
% %Using the bound from Bezout's theorem, one gets 128, which is much
% %higher than the actual number of solutions.
% maxBound=numPolySolBoundBezout(termMats,1)
% %Though much slower, when using the multihomogenerous Bezout bound, one
% %gets a solution of 16, which coincides with the actual number of
% %solutions to the system.
% maxBound=numPolySolBoundBezout(termMats,2)
% %The approximate multihomogeneous Bezout bound gives 64, which is better
% %than the bound from Bezout's theorem, but is worse than the true
% multihomogeneous Bezout bound. On the other hand, the approximation is
% significantly faster than the exact multihomogeneous Bezout bound.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%This is the equation in example 2.3 of [1] with a=1.
% termMats=cell(3,1);
% theEq='0.5*x2^2+2*x2*x3+0.5*x3^2+x2^3*x3^2-1';
% termMats{1}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='0.5*x3^2+2*x3*x1+0.5*x1^2+x3^3*x1^2-1';
% termMats{2}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% theEq='0.5*x1^2+2*x1*x2+0.5*x2^2+x1^3*x2^2-1';
% termMats{3}=string2Terms(theEq,8);
% maxBound0=numPolySolBoundBezout(termMats,0)
% maxBound1=numPolySolBoundBezout(termMats,1)
% maxBound2=numPolySolBoundBezout(termMats,2)
%In this example, maxBound0 is 125, maxBound1 is 35, and maxBound2 is also
%35. In this instance, the approximate multihomogeneous Bezout bound equals
%the exact one.

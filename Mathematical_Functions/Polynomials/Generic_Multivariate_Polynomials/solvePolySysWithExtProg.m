function [xSol,otherInfo]=solvePolySysWithExtProg(polyStrings,varNames,algorithm,opts,scratchFolderPath,execPath)
%%SOLVEPOLYSYSWITHEXTPROG Solve a system of simultaneous multivariate
%            polynomials using an external program (which must be installed
%            on this computer). Programs supported are Bertini, PHCpack and
%            the certified solver in NAG4M2 in Macaulay2. All of the
%            programs read input files and then write their results to
%            disk. This function formats the input, and then reads the
%            output.
%
%INPUTS: polyStrings A numPolyX1 or 1XnumPoly cell array containing the
%           polynomials given as strings. The variable names should begin
%           with letters but may containg numbers. Imaginary coefficients
%           should be indicated by i in Bertini and PHCpack and by ii when
%           using NAG4M2 in Macaulay2. An example of a valid equation for
%           Bertini and PHCpack is 'x^2+(1+2*i)*y^2'. Variable names should
%           not contain numbers when using Bertini.
%  varNames A numVarX1 or 1XnumVar cell array containing the names
%           used for the different variables in polyStrings. For example,
%           'x'. Generally, numVar=numPoly. No variable is allowed to be
%           named 'i', 'ii' or be named 'eqn' followed by a number.
%           Variable names should not contain numbers when using Bertini.
% algorithm An optional parameter specifying which algorithm to use. The
%          solvers for simultaneous multivariate polynomials are external
%          programs. Possible values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use
%            Bertini.
%          1 Use PHCpack.
%          2 Use the certified homotopy algorithm that is built into
%            Macaulay2 (in NAG4M2). This only uses the normalized solver
%            with the default options.
%      opts An optional input specifying options for the solver. This is
%           not used with Macaulay2; with PHCpack, it is a string of extra
%           options to pass to the solver. For example, '-t8' makes the
%           solver use eight threads to solve the problem, speeding up the
%           solution on multicore systems. For Bertini, this is a structure
%           configuration containing parameters to set. The name of the
%           entry in the structure elects the option and the value is the
%           value associated with the option. For example, if one wishes to
%           change the final tolerance, one can just use
%           opts.EndpointFiniteThreshold=1e-14. If Bertini has been
%           compiled with support for the message passing interface and the
%           mpirun command exists on this computer, then one can include
%           the parameter MPIRunProcs set to an integer above 0 and that
%           many processes will be used to parallelize Bertini. Setting the
%           number too high will result in slower performance. This
%           parameter can be omitted or an empty matrix passed if default
%           values should not be changed.
% scratchFolderPath An optional parameter specifying the folder in which
%           temporary files will be written. This is needed, because
%           all solvers only works through files. If this parameter is
%           omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then a folder named temp
%           in the folder enclosing this function is used. Note that if an
%           error occurs while executing this function, then temporary
%           files might be left in the temp folder after this function
%           ends.
%  execPath The command line command to use to execute the solver. The 
%           default if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is 
%           passed is just the standard name on the command line: bertini,
%           phc and M2 for each of the algorithms. The default assumes that
%           the program is already in the default search path. For example,
%           on *NIX systems, one can usually put the executable in
%           /usr/local/bin for it to be in the default search path.
%           However, for some reason, that directory is often not
%           included in Matlab's search path. Matlab 2016a's help under
%           "Run External Commands, Scripts, and Programs" specifically
%           says how to add that folder to the default search path.
%
%OUTPUTS: xSol The numVarXnumSol isolated (complex) solutions found to the
%              polynomial. The variables are in the same order as they
%              appear in varNames.
%    otherInfo Other info returned by the solver. For algorithm 0, this is
%              the text returned by the solver on the command line. For
%              algorithm 2, this is not used and an empty matrix is
%              returned. For algorithm 1, this is a structure with elements
%              multiplicity A numSolX1 vector of the multiplicity of each
%                  solution.
%              err A numSolX1 vector of magnitudes of last correction term 
%                  used in Newton's method when solving for each root.
%              rco A numSolX1 vector of the estimated inverse condition 
%                  numbers of the roots. This relates to numerical
%                  stability.
%              res A numSolX1 vector of magnitudes of the polynomial vector
%                  evaluated at each root.
%
%Note that if the external solver fails, then this function will usually
%have an error when trying to read the solutions and the temporary files
%will not always be deleted. Note that one can place calls to this function
%in try-catch statements to keep it from having an error if the solver
%fails.

%%FUNCTIONS FOR BERTINI
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
function [xSol,solverText]=solvePolySysUsingBertini(polyStrings,varNames,opts,MPIRunProcs,scratchFolderPath,BertiniPath)
%%SOLVEPOLYSYSUSINGBERTINI Solve a system of simultaneous multivariate
%           polynomials using the external program Bertini. This function
%           just formats the input, properly passes it to Bertini and reads
%           the output. Bertini only takes inputs as files on disk and
%           provides outputs as files. It is assumed that the polynomial
%           system has a finite number of soluitons. Note that this
%           function cannot be used in a parfor loop unless care is taken
%           to allow different function instances to use different scartch
%           folders.
%
%INPUTS: polyStrings A numPolyX1 or 1XnumPoly cell array containing the
%           polynomials given as strings. The variable names should begin
%           with letters but may containg numbers. Imaginary coefficients
%           should be indicated by i. An example of a valid equation is
%           'x^2+(1+2*i)*y^2'.
%  varNames A numVarX1 or 1XnumVar cell array containing the names
%           used for the different variables in polyStrings. For example,
%           'x'. Generally, numVar=numPoly. No variable is allowed to be
%           named'i' or be named 'eqn' followed by a number.
%      opts An optional  structure containg options to pass to Bertini.
%           These are the same options that one would use when making an
%           input file on the command line. The name of the entry in the
%           structure elects the option and the value is the value
%           associated with the option. For example, if one wishes to
%           change the final tolerance, one can just use
%           opts.EndpointFiniteThreshold=1e-14. THis parameter can be
%           omitted or an empty matrix passed if default values should not
%           be changed.
%  MPIRunProcs Bertini can be compiled to run multiple processes using the
%           message passing interface standard (MPI). If that is the case,
%           then one can provide this parameter to specify how many threads
%           should be run. If this parameter is omitted, an empty matrix is
%           passed, or if MPIRunProcs=0, then Bertini is called without
%           using the mpi program (the mpirun command on the command line).
% scratchFolderPath An optional parameter specifying the folder in which
%           temporary files will be written. This is needed, because
%           Bertini only works through files. If this parameter is omitted
%           or an empty matrix is passed, then a folder named temp in the
%           folder enclosing this function is used. Note that if an error
%           occurs while executing this function, then temporary files
%           might  be left in the temp folder.
% BertiniPath The command line command to use to execute Bertini. The 
%           default if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is 
%           passed is just bertini, which assumes that the program is
%           already in the default search path. For example, on *NIX
%           systems, one can usually put the executable in /usr/local/bin
%           for it to be in the default search path.
%
%OUTPUTS: xSol The numVarXnumSol isolated (complex) solutions found to the
%              polynomial. The variables are in the same order as they
%              appear in varNames.
%   solverText The text of the status message that is printed by bertini on
%              the command line when it exits.
%
%This function work by writing the commands for Bertini to a file and then
%calling Bertini to solve the problem. Bertini does not allow the output
%files to be given non-default names. Thus, one cannot run multiple
%instances of this file in a parfor loop in Matlab without making each
%instance use a different scratch folder.
%
%Binaries and ource code for Bertini can be downloaded from

%%FUNCTIONS FOR MACAULAY2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
function xSol=solvePolySysUsingMacaulay2(polyStrings,varNames,scratchFolderPath,M2Path)
%%SOLVEPOLYSYSUSINGMACAULAY2 This function uses the certified multivariate
%           polynomial rooting algorithm in the NumericalAlgebraicGeometry
%           package of Macaulay2 to solve a system of simultaneous
%           multivariate polynomials. This function just formats the input
%           properly and passes it to the M2 function.
%
%INPUTS: polyStrings A numPolyX1 or 1XnumPoly cell array containing the
%           polynomials given as strings. The variable names should begin
%           with letters but may containg numbers. Imaginary coefficients
%           should be indicated by ii. An example of a valid equation is
%           'x^2+(1+2*ii)*y^2'. Note that 'ii' is used for a complex
%           variable instead of just i.
%  varNames A numVarX1 or 1XnumVar cell array containing the names
%           used for the different variables in polyStrings. For example,
%           'x'. Generally, numVar=numPoly.
% scratchFolderPath An optional parameter specifying the folder in which
%           temporary files will be written. This is needed, because
%           Macaulay2 only works through files. If this parameter is 
%           omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then a folder named temp
%           in the folder enclosing this function is used. Note that if an
%           error occurs while executing this function, then temporary
%           files might  be left in the temp folder.
%    M2Path The command line command to use to execute Macaulay2 The
%           default if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%           passed is just M2, which assumes that the program is already
%           in the default search path. For example, on *NIX systems, one
%           can usually put the executable in /usr/local/bin for it to be
%           in the default search path. On Mac OS X, the executable is
%           often placed in a folder like
%           '/Applications/Macaulay2-1.8.2/bin/M2', which is not in the
%           default search path for the system unless one adds it.
%
%OUTPUTS: xSol The numVarXnumSol isolated (complex) solutions found to the
%              polynomial. Note that solutions marked as failing in the
%              refinement step of the algorithm are not marked as such
%              here.
%
%This function works by writing the commands to call Macaulay2 to a
%temporary file, calling the function, can then reading the output file.
%The files are given filenames with UUIDs in the names so that multiple
%instances of M2 can be run at the same time if one uses a parfor loop in
%Matlab (assuming that the parallel processing toolbox is installed).
%
%Binaries and source code for Macaulay2 may be downloaded from
%http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/
%The algorithm implemented in Macaulay2 that is called here is described in
%[1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
% polyStrings=cell(2,1);
% polyStrings{1}='-x1^2+2*x1*x2+x2^2+5*x1-3*x2-4';
% polyStrings{2}='x1^2+2*x1*x2+x2^2-1';
% varNames={'x1','x2'};
% xSol=solvePolySysUsingMacaulay2(polyStrings,varNames)
% %One should get the solutions (0,-1), (1,0), (3,-2), and (4,-5).

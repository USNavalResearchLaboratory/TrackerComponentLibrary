function termMat=string2Terms(theString,numVars)
%%STRING2TERMS Given a string representing a real multidimensional
%           polynomial equation, convert it into a matrix of terms of the
%           polynomial.
%
%INPUTS: theString The string representing the multivariate polynomial with
%           real coefficients. All coefficients come before variables.
%           Variables are all x followed by a number, such as x3. All
%           numbers for variables must be >0. No parenthesis should be
%           used. This formatting is less permissive than in string2Terms.
%           For example, 
%           '60*x2^2-4*x2^3+72*x1*x2+12' is a valid string.
%   numVars This is an optional parameter indicating the number of
%           spaces to leave for variables in termMat. This must be equal to
%           or larger than the highest number of the variable in the
%           string. This is used to make termMat have a larger number of
%           indices for exponents (rows) than the maximum exponent number.
%           If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, only enough spaces for
%           the variables in theString is used. numVars less than the
%           required minimum amount of space means that numVars will be
%           ignored.
%
%OUTPUTS: termMat An (n+1)XnumTerms matrix such that
%           termMat(:,i)=[c,a1,a2,...,an] is a monomial term where c is the
%           value of of the monomial coefficient and the monomial is
%           x1^(a1-1)*x2^(a2-1)*x3^(a3-1)...xn^(an-1).
%           n is the highest numbered used to index a variable in
%           theString, or is numVars, whichever is larger. Thus, one
%           should not use needlessly high indices in the string.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%  theString='x1*x3-2*x2*x3-6*x1-x2-4*x4+12';
%  termMat=string2Terms(theString)
%Here termMat is 5X1, having space for coefficients of each of the four
%variables.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%  theString='x2*x3-2*x2*x3-x2-4*x4+12';
%  termMat=string2Terms(theString)
%Here, termMat is again 5X1, even though there are three variables (x1 is
%gone). This is because the coefficient number corresponds to a position.
%
%EXAMPLE 3
%  theString='x2*x3-2*x2*x3-x2-4*x4+12';
%  termMat=string2Terms(theString,5)
%This is the same as the second example, except there is an extra empty
%row.

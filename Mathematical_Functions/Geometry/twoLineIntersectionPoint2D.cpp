/*TWOLINEINTERSECTIONPOINT2D A C++ implementation of a function that given
 *                    two (infinite) 2D lines that are not parallel, finds
 *                    the point of intersection. A line is specified by
 *                    providing two points on the line.
 *
 *INPUTS: line1 A 2X2 matrix of two points in the first line where
 *              line1(1,:) are the x-coordinates and line1(2,:) are the
 *               y-coordinates.
 *         line2 A 2X2 matrix of two points in the second line defined the
 *               same way as line1.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: point The 2X1 intersection point of the two lines given as [x;y]
 *               components.
 *
 *The formula in terms of matrix determinants is taken from [1].
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *point=twoLineIntersectionPoint2D(line1,line2);

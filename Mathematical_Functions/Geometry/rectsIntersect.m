function doesIntersect=rectsIntersect(rectMin1,rectMax1,rectMin2,rectMax2,containedIntersects)
%%RECTSINTERSECT Determine whether two axis-aligned rectangles (or more
%                general axis-aligned hyperrectangles if the number of
%                dimensions is not 2) overlap at all. The handling of the
%                case where one rectangle is completely contained in
%                another without intersecting boundaries can be specified.
%
%INPUTS: rectMin1 A kX1 or 1Xk vector of the lower bounds of each of the
%                 dimensions of the first k-dimensional hyperrectangle.
%        rectMax1 A kX1 or 1Xk vector of the upper bounds of the first
%                 hyperectangle.
%        rectMin2 A kX1 or 1Xk vector of the lower bounds of the second
%                 hyperrectangle.
%        rectMax2 A kX1 or 1Xk vector of the upper bounds of the second
%                 hyperrectangle.
% containedIntersects An optional boolean parameter. If false, then two
%                 hyperrectangles where one is completely contained in
%                 another are not considered to intersect. Otherwise, they
%                 are considered to intersect. The default if omitted or an
%                 empty matrix is passed is false;
%
%OUTPUTS: doesIntersect A boolean value that is true if the hyperrectangles
%                       intersect and false otherwise.

/*POINTISINPOLYGON A C++ implementation of a function that given a polygon
*               specified by a number of vertices, determines whether a
*               point is in the polygon. A simple polygon has lines that
*               do not cross. If the polygon is not simple (is
*               self-intersecting), then the even-odd rule is used to
*               determine whether a point is in the polygon or not. As the
*               algorithm is a type of winding number algorithm, the
*               winding number omega can also be obtained.
*
*INPUTS: vertices A 2XN matrix of the N vertices making up the polygon in
*                 order. Edges are between neighboring vertices. The last
*                 vertex can be the same as the first vertex. If not, it is
*                 assumed that an edge exists between the last and first
*                 vertices.
*           point A 2XnumPoints set of points that will be determined to be
*                 inside or outside of the polygon given by vertices.
* boundaryIsImportant An optional boolean variable indicating whether the
*                 boundary of the polygon is important. If
*                 boundaryIsImportant=true, then an algorithm that will
*                 correctly indicate points on the boundary as being in
*                 the polygon will be used. If it is false, then the
*                 results for points on the boundary can be inconsistent,
*                 though the algorithm will be slightly faster. The default
*                 is true.
*
*OUTPUTS: isInPolygon An NX1 vector where the ith element is true if the
*                     ith is true if the ith point is in the polygon, false
*                     otherwise. If boundaryIsImportant=false, the results
*                     can be inconsistent on the boundary of the polygon.
*              omegas An NX1 vector of the integer winding number obtained
*                     for each point. This is not meainingful for points on
*                     the boundary of the polygon. 
*
*The implementation is Algorithms 6 and 7 from [1].
*
* The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
* CompileCLibraries function.
*
* The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
* [isInPolygon,omegas]=pointIsInPolygon(vertices,point,boundaryIsImportant);
* or
* [isInPolygon,omegas]=pointIsInPolygon(vertices,point);

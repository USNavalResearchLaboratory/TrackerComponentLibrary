function rMean=meanRad4Ellipsoid(a,f)
%%MEANRAD4ELLIPSOID Given an ellipsoid of rotation, determine the
%               mean radius of the ellipsoid. This can be useful for
%               spherical approximations.
%
%INPUTS: a The semi-major axis length of the ellipsoid. If this argument is
%          omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the value in
%          Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%        f The flattening factor of the ellipsoid. If this argument is
%          omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the value in
%          Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: rMean The mean radius for the specified 3D ellipsoid.
%
%The formula for the mean radius of an ellipsoid is given in [1].

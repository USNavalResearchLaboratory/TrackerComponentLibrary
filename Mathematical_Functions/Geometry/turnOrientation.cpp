/**TURNORIENTATION Given 3 two-dimensional vertices in order, determine
 *                 whether they form a left turn (go counterclockwise).
 *                 Such a determination is necessary for determining
 *                 whether a polygon is convex and plays a role in
 *                 finding the convex hull of a set of points.
 * 
 *INPUTS: v1, v2, v3 A set of 3 2XN matrices, of N vertex sets in the order
 *                   [x;y] These are 2-dimensional vertices in order,
 *                   whereby one wishes to determine whether the angle
 *                   v1-v2-v3 is going counterclockwise (left) or clockwise
 *                   (right) for each set of vertices.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: turnDir An NX1 vector where the ith element is is 1 if the ith
 *                 set of vertices form a counterclockwise angle, -1 if
 *                 they are going clockwise and 0 if they are collinear or
 *                 if two of them coincide.
 * 
 *The implementation uses the long double datatype to provide a result with
 *lower finite precision errors in intermediate results then if everything
 *were done using doubles, since most compiler implement the long double as
 *an IEEE-754 double extended precision datatype. A notable exception is
 *Microsoft's Visual Studio (as of 2017), which maps long doubles to
 *doubles (64 bits rather than the 80-bit size of Intel/ AMD floating point
 *registers) as noted in 
 *https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-language/type-long-double
 *Additionally, the function exactSignOfSumCPP is used to provide the sign
 *of an error-free sum. Unfortunately, since the IEEE-754 double extended
 *precision datatype only provides a 64-bit mantissa, which is not much of
 *an extension over the 54-bit mantissa of a standard double precision
 *floating point number, and is not enough to assure no finite precision
 *rounding in the products that go into the sum, one cannot guarantee zero
 *finite precision errors in this function. On the other hand, if the
 *inputs are single-precision (promoted to doubles, since the function does
 *not take singles) floating point numbers, the result is exact.
 *
 *The cross product rule for 3D vectors a and b says that
 *norm(cross(a,b))=norm(a)*norm(b)*sin(theta)
 *where theta is the positive angle between the vectors. However, If the
 *vectors are 2D, (set the z-components to zero), then the cross product
 *only have one nonzero component in the z-direction and that component is
 *equal to det([a,b]) (for 2D a and b). The interesting thing now, is that
 *the sign of the determinant will tell you whether the subsequent vectors
 *are going counterclockwise or clockwise. This function returns -1 if the
 *vectors are going counterclockwise, 0 if they are exactly collinear and 1
 *if they are clockwise.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *turnDir=turnOrientation(v1,v2,v3);

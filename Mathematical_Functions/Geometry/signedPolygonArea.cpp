/*SIGNEDPOLYGONAREA A C++ implementation of an algorithm to calculate the
 *                  signed area of a non-self-intersecting 2D polygon given
 *                  its vertices. The magnitude of the area is the typical
 *                  definition of area that one might expect. The sign of
 *                  the area is positive if the points are arranged in a
 *                  counterclockwise order around the polygon and negative
 *                  if the points are in a clockwise order.
 *
 *INPUTS: vertices A 2XN list of the N vertices of the polygon in order
 *                 around the polygon. Duplicate vertices are allowed. It
 *                 does not matter whether or not the first vertex is
 *                 repeated at the end.
 *
 *OUTPUTS:       A The signed area of the polygon.
 *
 *The formula for computing the signed area of a non-self-intersecting is
 *taken from [1[.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *A=signedPolygonArea(vertices);

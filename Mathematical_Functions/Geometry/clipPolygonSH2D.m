function clippedPolygon=clipPolygonSH2D(polygon2Clip,convexClipPolygon,makeFirstEqualLast)
%%CLIPPOLYGONSH2D Clip a non-self-intersecting polygon to a region
%                 specified by a convex polygon using a 2D implementation
%                 of the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm. If the polygon being
%                 clipped was concave at the vertices outside of the
%                 clipping region, the resulting clipped polygon will have
%                 overlapping edges on the boundary of the region rather
%                 than being split into multiple separate polygons.
%
%INPUTS: polygon2Clip A 2XN list of N>=3 vertices making up the polygon of
%                     the form [x;y]. It does not matter whether vertices
%                     are repeated.
%   convexClipPolygon A 2XNClip list of NClip>=3 vertices making up the
%                     convex clipping polygon. Vertices should not be
%                     repeated. The first vertex must not be repeated on
%                     the end. The vertices must be in a counterclockwise
%                     order.
%  makeFirstEqualLast If this is true, then the last element in the clipped
%                     polygon will be guaranteed to equal the first
%                     element, thus fully closing the polygon. The default
%                     if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is true.
%
%OUTPUTS: clippedPolygon The polygon polygon2Clip clipped to the convex
%                        region specified by convexClipPolygon. If
%                        polygon2Clip is completely does not intersect with
%                        the clipping region, an empty matrix is returned.
%                        If the clipping region is engulfed by the polygon,
%                        then the polygon will be the clipping region.
%
%The Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm is originally from [1], though the
%authors focus a lot of its attention on clipping polyhedra to planes. A
%quick search online will yield many result explaining how it works in 2D
%in a more intuitive manner. The original paper also includes a technique
%for dividing a polygon into multiple parts when it is split by the
%clipping region rather than just having coincident edges on the edge of
%the clipping region. 
%
%The Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm requires that the vertices in the
%clipping polygon be in counterclockwise order.
%
%The maximum number of vertices on the clipped polygon is if every other
%vertex of the polygon to clip is outside of the clipping region, as each
%exit/ entry to the clipping region adds two vertices. Thus, the maximum
%number of edges is 3/2 times the original number.

%%VERTEXISINSIDECLIPPEDEDGE Determine whether a vertex is inside of the
%clipping region given an edge. This relies on the fact that the clipping
%region is convex and goes in a counterclockwise direction. Thus, the sign
%of the angle with respect to the clipping edge is used to determine
%whether it is inside or outside. This could be done by extending the
%vectors to 3D (padding a zero on the ends) and then using a cross
%product, whereby the z component would tell us the sign, but the value of
%the z-component is the same as the determinant value used here.
%
%INPUTS:  vertex The 2X1 vertex to test whether it is on the correct size
%                of the edge to be in the clipping region.
%    clipVertex1 The first 2X1 vertex of the boundary used to form the
%                edge for clipping.
%       clipEdge The edge vector, which would be clipVertex2-clipVertex1.
%
%The code below is equivalent to
%isInsideClipEdge=det([vertex-clipVertex1,clipEdge])<=0;
%but should be slightly less susceptible to finite precision errors.

    S=[-clipEdge(1)*vertex(2);
        clipEdge(2)*vertex(1);
       -clipEdge(2)*clipVertex1(1);
        clipEdge(1)*clipVertex1(2)];

function [zCent,r]=inscribedSphere4Tetrahedron(v)
%%INSCRIBEDPHERE4TETRAHEDRON Find the center and radius of an
%       inscribed sphere for a given tetrahedron. An inscribed sphere is
%       the smallest sphere that touches all of the faces of the
%       tetrahedon.
%       
%INPUTS: v A 3X4 set of the 4 3D vertices of the tetrahedron.
%
%OUTPUTS: zCent The 3X2 center of the inscribed sphere of the tetrahedron.
%             r The radius of the inscribed sphere.
%
%While formulae are given in [1], it is not actually necessary to solve a
%linear set of equations to get the center of the inscribed circle. In [2],
%it is noted that the inscribed sphere touches each face of the tetrahedron
%at the centroid of each face. A similar relation is given in 4 of lemma 4
%of [3].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, the sides of a tetrahedron are drawn as well as the inscribed
%sphere. Depending on the dimensions of the tetrahdron, the sphere might be
%small or large.

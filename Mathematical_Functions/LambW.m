function w=LambW(z,k)
%%LAMBDW Evaluate the primary branch and the -1 branch of the Lambert-W
%        function, which is also know as a product logarithm. The function
%        solve z=w*exp(w) for w. This implementation is meant for real
%        values of z>=-1/exp(1) and will have an error on smaller values,
%        which would normally return complex solutions.
%
%INPUTS: z A vector or matrix of parameters at which the primary branch of
%          the Lambert W function is to be evaluated. It is assumed that
%          z>=-exp(-1) for all of the elements.
%        k An optional parameter specifying the branch of the algorithm to
%          take. k=0 means the primary branch and -1 means the alternative
%          real branch. This only affects solutions for z<=0.
%
%OUTPUTS: w The solutions to z=w*exp(w) for all elements in z.
%
%Note that a loss of precision will occur for negative values on the -1
%branch around approximately abs(z)<1e-307.
%
%The origin of the algorithm is [1], where the main algorithm is Halley's
%method from Equation 5.9. For negative values on the primary branch, an
%initial value of the first few terms of Equation 4.22 is used. For
%positive values less than 1.1, an initial value of 0 is used. For positive
%values greater than or equal to 1.1, the first two perms of Equation 4.18
%are used. This same initialization (taking advantage of absolute values)
%is used for negative values on the k-1 branch. This differs from the
%suggested method in the paper in that a Pade approximation is not used for
%terms near zero. Rather, a constant initial estimate of 0 is used. 15
%iterations are performed, which should be more than enough to converge.

function areRPrime=areRelativelyPrime(a)
%%ARERELATIVELYPRIME Determine whether a set of numbers is relatively
%               prime (are coprime). A collections of numbers are
%               relatively prime if the greatest common divisor between all
%               pairs of the numbers is 1. Relatively prime numbers are
%               also known as coprime numbers.
%
%INPUTS: a An nXnumSets set of numSets sets of n-integers where one wishes
%          to determine whether the n numbers in each set are relatively
%          prime.
%
%OUTPUTS: areRPrime A numSetsX1 boolean array indicating whether the
%                   numbers in each set are coprime.
%
%Coprime numbers arise in a number of areas, such as in the Chinese
%remainder theorem. This function just goes through all pairs of numbers
%and uses the gcd function to see whether the greatest common divisor
%between all pairs is 1.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% a=zeros(3,2);
% %This set of numbers is coprime even though 4 is not a prime number.
% a(:,1)=[7;9;4];
% %This set of numbers is not coprime
% a(:,2)=[3;2;9];
% areRPrime=areRelativelyPrime(a)
%The functions returns [1;0]

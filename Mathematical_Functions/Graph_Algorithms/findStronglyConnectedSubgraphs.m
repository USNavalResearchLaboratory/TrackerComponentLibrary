%%FINDSTRONGLYCONNECTEDSUBGRAPHS Given an adjacency matrix of a directed
%               graph, identify all of the strongly connected subgraphs.
%               Two vertices v and w are strongly connected if one can
%               follow the graph to go from v->w as well as from w->v. For
%               example, all cycles are strongly connected. A strongly
%               connected subgraph is one where all of the vertices in the
%               subgraph are strongly connected.
%
%INPUTS: adjMat An adjacency matrix of a graph. Vertex i is connected to
%               vertex j if adjMat(i,j)>=-Inf. adjMat(i,j)=Inf means that
%               the vertices are not connected.
%
%OUTPUTS: setStartList A numSubgraphsX1 list of the starting index of the 
%               vertices for each of the stringly connected subgraphs in 
%               setIdxList. The length of setStartList equals the number of
%               strongly connected subgraphs.
%    setLengths A numSubgraphsX1 list of the number of vertices in each
%               subgraph.
%    setIdxList A list of indices of the vertices in a subgraph. The
%               vertices in the ith subgraph are given by
%               setIdxList(setStartList(i):(setStartList(i)+setLengths(i)-1))
%  subgraphList This is a length-numSubgraphsX1 cell array where
%               subgraphList{i} contains the subset of the adjacency matrix
%               containing only the vertices of the ith strongly connected
%               subgraph. The ordering of the rows and columns of the
%               subgraph corresponds to the ordering of the indices in
%               setIdxList that list the nodes in the subgraph.
%
%The algorithm of Cheriyan and Mehlhorn [1] is implemented here. The
%complexity would be O(numVertices+numEdges) if the graph were sparse.
%however, since adjacency matrix is scanned for edges, rather
%than edges being given in a separate list, the complexity is higher. 
%
%Many authors refer to the algorithm of [2], which is essentially the same
%as that of [1], except the pseudocode in the paper contains some errors
%(e.g. popping an empty stack) and will not work as written.
%
%Consider the following example:
% adjMat=[Inf, 1,     1,      Inf,    Inf,    Inf;
%         Inf, Inf,   1,      1,      Inf,    Inf;
%         Inf, Inf,   Inf,    Inf,    Inf,    Inf;
%         Inf, Inf,   1,      Inf,    1,      Inf;
%         Inf, 1,     Inf,    Inf,    Inf,    1;
%         Inf, Inf,   1,      1,      Inf,    Inf];
% [setStartList,setLengths,setIdxList]=findStronglyConnectedSubgraphs(adjMat)
%The results are setStartList=[1;2;6], setLengths=[1;4;1], and
%setIdxList =[3;2;6;5;4;1]; This corresponds to three stringly connected
%subgraphs. One is just vertex 3, another is just vertex 1, and the last
%one is vertices 2,6,5, and 4.

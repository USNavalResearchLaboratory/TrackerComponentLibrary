function [F,totalCost,exitCode]=minCostFlow(AMat,CMat,b,maxIter)
%%MINCOSTFLOW Solve the minimum cost flow problem using a strong polynomial
%             time cycle cancelling algorithm that works with non-integer
%             costs. Minimum cost flow problems include transportation
%             problems.
%
%INPUTS: AMat An NXN matrix of costs in a directed graph such that
%             AMat(i,j) is the cost of an edge going from vertex i to
%             vertex j. If no vertex goes from node i to node j, then a
%             cost of 0 should be inserted.
%        CMat An NXN matrix of capacities of the edges in the graph.
%             CMat(i,j) is the capacity of an edge from node i to node j.
%             If no edge exists, then a capacity of zero should be used. It
%             is assumed that all capacities are finite.
%           b An NX1 vector of the supply provided by each node. It is
%             required that sum(b)=0.
%     maxIter An optional parameter specifying the maximum number of
%             iterations that should be performed by the algorithm. If
%             omitted, a maximum of 100+10*N iterations is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: F The flow matrix. F(i,j) is the amount of flow going from node i
%           to node j. Note that F(i,j)=-F(j,i). If the algorithm could not
%           obtain an initial feasible solution, then an empty matrix is
%           returned. If the maximum number of iterations is exceeded, then
%           the algorithm will return a feasible solution that is not
%           optimal.
% totalCost The total cost of the flow. This is the quantity being
%           minimized. If the algorithm could not obtain an initial
%           feasible solution, then an empty matrix is returned.
%  exitCode A parameter indicating whether an error occurred or whether the
%           algorithm terminated successfully. Possible values are:
%           0 The algorithm was successful.
%           1 No feasible solution could be found.
%           2 The maximum number of iterations was reached.
%           3 Inputs are invalid. This means that either C contains NaN
%             values, sum(b)~=0 or AMat contains nonfinite values.
%
%The minimum cost flow problems seeks to find a flow F to minimize
%sum(sum(AMat.*F)) subject to the constraints:
%4) Total Vertex Flow: sum(F(i,:))=b(i) for all i.
%2) Capacity Constraint: 0<=F(u,v)<=CMat(u,v)
%3) Skew Symmetry: F(u,v)=-F(v,u)
%Whereas the maximum flow problem, which is solved in the function
%solveMaxFlowEdmondsKarp seeks to maximize the flow between two nodes the
%minimum cost flow problem seeks to minimize the total cost of a fixed
%amount of flow.
%
%The strong polynomial cycle cancelling algorithm of [1] is used. However,
%the epsilon-based convergence acceleration method described in [1] is not
%used. Rather, the algorithm is more similar to the simple cycle
%cancellation algorithm of Chapter 7.2 of [2], except the minimum mean
%cycle is always augmented rather than any negative cost cycle.
%
%The complexity of the non-epsilon accelerated algorithm in [1] is bounded
%as O(N^2*m^3*log(N)), where N is the number of vertices in the graph, and
%m is the number of edges. The true complexity depends on the efficiency of
%the function computeResidualCapacity, which is used to obtain the negative
%cycles.
%
%EXAMPLE: This is example 7.1 in Chapter 7.2 of [2].
% AMat=[0, 4, 1, 0;
%       0, 0, 2, 5;
%       0, 3, 0, 2;
%       0, 0, 0, 0];
% CMat=[0, 2, 2, 0;
%       0, 0, 1, 1;
%       0, 1, 0, 1;
%       0, 0, 0, 0];%Capacity matrix
% b=[2;0;0;-2];
% [F,totalCost,exitCode]=minCostFlow(AMat,CMat,b)
%One will get a flow matrix of 
% F =[ 0     0     2     0;
%      0     0    -1     1;
%     -2     1     0     1;
%      0    -1    -1     0];
%having a total cost of 12.
%
%OTHER EXAMPLES: Transportation problems can be transformed into minimum
%cost flow problems and vice versa, as shown in Chapters 7.4 and 7.5 of
%[2]. Thus, the examples in the comments to the function
%solveTransportationProblem can be taken as additional examples of the
%minimum cost flow problem.

%Step 1: Find a feasible flow.
%In this step, we must find a feasible flow F. This is a flow that
%satisfies constraints 1-3 but does not necessarily minimize the cost
%sum(sum(AMat.*F)). This can be done by ignoring costs and solving a
%maximum flow problem based only on the constraints. The maximum flow
%problem does not have demand constraints on all of the nodes, rather it
%only has them on a sink and source which are added.
%
%To enforce constraint 1, we have to create a network with an artificial
%sink and source. If b(i) is positive, then we need an arc from the source
%to that node with capacity b(i). If b(i) is negative, then we need an arc
%from the sink to that node with capacity -b(i). If the maximum flow
%problem solved on the modified graph saturates all of the edges coming out
%of the source, then the problem is feasible.

%Augment the capacity matrix.

%equal for feasible problems, though they seem to generally be equal for

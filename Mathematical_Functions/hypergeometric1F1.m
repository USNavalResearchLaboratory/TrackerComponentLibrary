function val=hypergeometric1F1(a,b,z,nMax)
%HYPERGEOMETRIC1F1 Evaluate the regular confluent hypergeometric function
%                  1F1(a;b;z) (the Kummer confluent hypergeometric
%                  function).
%
%INPUTS: a,b,z Three real or complex scalar numbers.
%         nMax The maximum number of iterations to perform to try to
%              achieve convergence. The default if omitted or an empty
%              matrix is passed is 50.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The scalar value of 1F1(a;b;z). 
%
%Hypergeometric functions arise in many applications, including
%combinatorics. This function is implemented using Buchholz polynomial as
%described in [1].

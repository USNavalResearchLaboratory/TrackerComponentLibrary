function intVal=symIntThirdKindDegen(x,y,z)
%%SYNINTTHIRDKINDDEGEN Compute the degenerate symmetric integral of the
%                      third kind. This is 3/2 times the integral from 0 to
%                      infinity of ((t+x)*(t+y))^(-1/2)*(t+z)^(-3/2) dt.
%                      This integral arises when numerically evaluating
%                      elliptic integrals. Sometimes, the integral is
%                      referred to as RD.
%
%INPUTS: x,y,z The three parameters of the function. z cannot be zero and
%              at most one of x and y can be zero. When complex, the values
%              are assumed to have complex phase angles less than pi
%              in magnitude.
%
%OUTPUTS: intVal The value of the degenerate symmetric integral of the
%                third kind given x, y, and z.
%
%The algorithm is taken from [1].

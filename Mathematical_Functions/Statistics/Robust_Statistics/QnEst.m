function Qn=QnEst(x,scaleType,k,algorithm)
%%QNEST Compute the Q estimator of a real vector of points. This is a
%      robust estimation statistic, which is discussed as an alternative to
%      the median absolute deviation about the median (MAD) in [1]. As
%      described in [1] and [2], the Q-estimator is the kth order statistic
%      of abs(x(i)-x(j)) with i<j.
%
%INPUT: x A real nX1 vector of points. If an empty matrix is passed, the
%         NaN is returned.
% scaleType This parameter specifies how the Q estimate should be scaled.
%         Possible values are:
%         0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Do not
%            scale the estimate.
%         1 Scale the estimate to be asymptotically unbiased as an
%           estimator for the standard deviation of a Gaussian
%           distribution. The estimator is biased for small n.
%         2 Scale the estimate to be approximately unbiased for the given
%           n. This uses the low-precision empirically derived
%           multiplication factors given in [2].
%       k The order statistic to take. The default if omitted or an empty
%         matrix is passed is binomial(h-1,2), which is the value where the
%         scale values that one can choose above are valid. The maximum is
%         n*(n+1)/2-n. For binomial(h-1,2)+1<=k<=binomial(h,2), when no two
%         samples coincide, the breakdown point of the estimator is
%         maximized, as discussed in [1] and [2].
% algorithm An optional parameter specifying the algorithm used. Possible
%         values are:
%         0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use the
%           efficient algorithm of [2].
%         1 Use a brute-force approach, implied by the definition of the Q
%          estimator.
%
%OUTPUTS: Qn The Q-estimator.
%
%As derived in [1], if one assumes that the underlying distribution is
%Gaussian and one takes the limit of n->Inf, then the S estimator can be
%scaled as c*Sn to be an estimator of the standard deviation of a normal
%distribution. Specifically, the scale value is a value d after Equation
%3.7 in [1]:
%d=1/(sqrt(2)*GaussianD.invCDF(5/8))=2.2191444659850757931851380420763
%Note that the numeric value given in the paper appears to be slightly in
%error. Other contants can be found for estimating the standard deviation
%of other estimators. For the Gaussian distribution, it was empirically
%demonstrated that the estimates produced with small values of n are
%biased. Thus, additional empirical constants to debias the estimates were
%found in [2].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we sample a normal distribution and then use the scaled Q estimator
%to estimate the standard deviation.
% n=1e4;
% sigma=20;
% mu=-8;
% x=mu+sigma*randn(n,1);

%%MEANCOVBACON Given a set of samples of a distribution with outliers, 
%              compute the mean and covariance of the set of points using
%              the blocked adaptive computationally effcient outlier
%              nominators (BACON) algorithm of [1]. This algorithm tries to
%              efficient detect and eliminate the outliers.
%
%INPUTS: x A pXn set of n p-dimensional samples of the distribution. The
%          algorithm of [1] requires that n>1+3*p for the approximate
%          correction term cnp to be used. If n<=1+3*p, then the
%          approximate value of cnp given in the appendix of [2] is used.
%          It is still required that n>p.
%        m Optionally, one can specify the number of points to use in the
%          initial set of points used in the algorithm prior to iterating.
%          If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the default is
%          m=max(p+1,min(fix(n/4),4*p));
%  version Two algorithms for obtaining an initial estimate are given in
%          [1]. This parameter chooses between them. Possible values are:
%          1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use
%            algorithm 2, version V1 of [1].
%          2 Use algorithm 2, version V2 of [1].
% gammaVal The threshold for determining outliers. Due to the use of a
%          heuristic correction term (cnp) in the algorithm, this value
%          will only approximately be met. This is a value of the chi-
%          squared distribution with p degrees of freedom that is the PG
%          percentile for PG close to 1. If omitted or an empty matrix
%          is passed, then the value for the 99.97% value of the
%          distribution with p degrees of freedom is used. The heuristic
%          correction is inaccurate when PG is not close to 1.
%  maxIter The maximum number of iterations of the algorithm to perform.
%          The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is n+p+1.
%          and should usually be more than enough.
%
%OUTPUTS: xb The pX1 mean vector after approximately omitting outliers.
%         Rb The pXp covariance matrix, exceluding approximate outliers.
%          d The Mahalanobis distances values of all of the observations
%            using xb as the mean and Rb as the covariance matrix.
%     minIdx The indices of the observations that were used to compute xb
%            and Rb.
%
%This function implements the algorithm of [1]. The gammaVal threshold is
%only approximate. The cnp term in [1] is used to approximately make it
%hold. However, it cannot be used if n<=1+3*p. Thus, for n in that range,
%the heuristic cnp term of [2] is used.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%Here, we have a bivariate Gaussian distribution polluted with 10% of its
%samples from another Gaussian distribution.
% xBarTrue=[4;3];
% RTrue=[12,-7;
%        -7,14];
% SRTrue=chol(RTrue,'lower');
% xPoll=[-120;6];
% RPoll=[1,   0.05;
%        0.05,0.1];
% SRPoll=chol(RPoll,'lower');
% 
% numTrue=10000;
% numPoll=1000;
% N=numTrue+numPoll;
% x=zeros(2,numTrue+numPoll);
% for k=1:numTrue
%     x(:,k)=xBarTrue+SRTrue*randn(2,1);
% end
% for k=(numTrue+1):N
%     x(:,k)=xPoll+SRPoll*randn(2,1);
% end
% [xb,Rb]=meanCovBACON(x)
% [xAll, RAll]=calcMixtureMoments(x)
%One will see that xb and Rb have a number of digits in common with
%xBarTrue and RTrue, whereas RAll is massively larger than RTrue and xTrue
%is farther from xBarTrue.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here, we demonstrate the accuracy of the heuristic correction that makes
%the gammaVal term hold. In this instance, the distribution in question is
%Gaussian and is NOT pullted by anything else. Thus, if out initial PG
%value from which gammaVal is derived is accurately modeled in
%meanCovBACON, then the observed ratio of points omitted should be the
%same.
% N=100;
% xBar=[4;3];
% R=[12,-7;
%        -7,14];
% SR=chol(R,'lower');
% numRuns=1000;
% 
% PG=0.9997;
% gammaVal=ChiSquareD.invCDF(PG,2);
% x=zeros(2,N);%Allocate space.
% PGObs=0;
% for curRun=1:numRuns
%     for k=1:N
%         x(:,k)=xBar+SR*randn(2,1);
%     end
%     [~,~,~,minIdx]=meanCovBACON(x,[],[],gammaVal);
% 
%     PGObs=PGObs+length(minIdx);
% end
% PGObs=PGObs/(N*numRuns)
%One will see that PGObs is close to PG. If one were to reduce PG to 0.8
%one would see that PGObs is much smaller that it should be (around 0.3).
%On the other hand, if N=6, and PG unchanged, one would see a lesser
%underestimate with PGObs around 0.94 rather than 0.9997. The approximation
%for gammaVal is more accurate for higher numbers of samples and PG values
%closer to 1.

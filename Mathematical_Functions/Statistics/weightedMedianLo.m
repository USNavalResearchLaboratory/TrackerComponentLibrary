function aLoMed=weightedMedianLo(a,w,algorithm)
%WEIGHTEDMEDIAN Compute the weighted lower median. This finds the largest
%               value a(k)such that the sum of the weights associated with
%               all a(i)>=a(k) is greater than half the total weight.
%
%INPUTS: a An nX1 or 1Xn real vector.
%        w A 1Xn or nX1 real vector of weights associated with the elements
%          of a. All w(i)>=0.
% algorithm An optional parameter specifying the algorithm to use. Possible
%          values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use a
%            modifed form of the efficient algorithm given in [1]. This is
%            an O(n) algorithm.
%          1 Sort the values and just go through w until the cumulative
%            value of w is >= wHalf. The sorting means that this will not be
%            better than O(n*log(n)).
%
%OUTPUTS: aHiMed The value of the weighted lower median in a. If a contains
%                a NaN, then an empty matrix will be returned.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we demonstrate on random problems that both approaches give the same
%result. When run, the assertion should always be true (no error occur).
% numEls=50;
% numRuns=10000;
% for curRun=1:numRuns
%     a=fix(10*rand(numEls,1));
%     w=fix(10*rand(numEls,1));
%     aLoMed0=weightedMedianLo(a,w,0);
%     aLoMed1=weightedMedianLo(a,w,1);
%     assert(aLoMed0==aLoMed1)

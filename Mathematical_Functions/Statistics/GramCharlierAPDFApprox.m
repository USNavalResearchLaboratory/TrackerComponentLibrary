%%GRAMCHARLIERAPDFAPPROX Obtain approximate values for a multivariate PDF
%               based on its quasi-moments using a Gram-Charlier series of
%               type A approximation. This approximation does not always
%               asymptotically converge to the true PDF producing the
%               quasi-moments as the number of quasi-moments used
%               increases. For example, for a scalar PDF, the asymptotic
%               decrease in the distribution must be faster than
%               exp(-x^2/4) to assure convergence.
%
%INPUTS: xVals The xDimXN set of N points for which the PDF values are
%              desired.
% quasiMomentMat A matrix taking n indices, where 
%              quasiMomentMat(a1,a2,a3...an) corresponds to the quasi-
%              moment whose multivariate order is given by a1-1,a2-1, etc.
%              It is assumed that quasi moments only up to an order equal
%              to the size of the first dimension of the matrix are
%              available (other entries in quasiMomentMat are ignored).
%              All other dimensions must be at least the same size as the
%              first. Also, the zero-th order moment must be 1 (as the PDF
%              integrates to 1). If a univariate distribution is used,
%              then this is a column vector.
%          muN The nX1 mean vector with respect to with the quasi-moments
%              are computed. This should generally be the mean of the
%              distribution being approxiamted. If this parameter is
%              omitted or an empty matrix is passed, a zero mean vector is
%              used.
%       SigmaN The nXn covariance matrix with respect to which the
%              quasi-moments are computed. This should generally be the
%              covariance matrix of the distribution being approximated.
%              If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%              the identity matrix is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: PDFVals The PDF approximated using the quasi-moments evaluated at
%               the points in xVals. If multiple points are given, the
%               result is a row vector. The values are not guaranteed to
%               always be positive.
%
%The Gram-Charlier A expansion is used in numerous papers on state
%estimation, but under various names, such as in [2,3,4,5]. A development
%of the expansion is given in [1]. The expressions here differ from [4] in
%that in [4] an incorrect normalization for multivariate distributions is
%used. Here, the multivariate Hermite polynomials of [6] are used. These
%polynomials specifically take a covariance matrix for a centered
%distribution.

%%GAMMASCALELIKECONJUPDATE When estimating the scale parameter of a central
%                   (lambda=0) gamma distribution having a known shape
%                   parameter, the conjugate prior distribution is an
%                   inverse gamma distribution. Given the shape parameter
%                   of the measurement distribution and the prior shape and
%                   rate parameter of the inverse gamma distribution, this
%                   function updates the prior parameters conditioned on
%                   the measurements. The result is the parameters of the
%                   posterior distribution, which is also an inverse gamma
%                   distribution.
%
%INPUTS: xMeas An NX1 or 1XN set of N independent measurements of the
%              central gamma distribution with shape parameter kMeas.
%        kMeas The shape parameter of the likelihood function.
%        kEst  The shape parameter of the prior distribution, which is an
%              inverse gamma distribution.
%      betaEst The rate parameter of the prior distribution.
%
%OUTPUTS:kEst The shape parameter of the posterior distribution, which is
%             an inverse gamma distribution.
%     betaEst The rate parameter of the posterior distribution.
%
%A distribution that is conjugate prior to a particular likelihood function
%is such that after performing Bayes' rule to update using a measurement,
%one obtains the same type of distribution back again. This function just
%performs Bayes rule with the given measurements.
%
%The conjugate prior relation for the gamma distribution with known shape
%parameter is given in [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%The function needs a prior distribution to work. Here, we show how
%estimation when given an uninformative prior yields consistent estimates
%when given a few measurements. The estimates are consistent in terms of
%the normalized estimation error squared (NEES) of the distribution implied
%by the outputs of this function.

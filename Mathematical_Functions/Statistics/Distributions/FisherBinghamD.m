    function val=PDF(x,A,g,normConst)
    %%PDF Evaluate the probability density function (PDF) of the
    %     Fisher-Bingham distribution at a given set of points. The
    %     Fisher-Bingham distribution comes from constainting an N.2
    %     dimensional Gaussian distribution to the unit sphere. However, it
    %     is normally parameterized slightly differently than a typical
    %     multivariate Gaussian and its parameters can take more general
    %     values. The PDF is f(x|A,g)=(1/c)*exp(-x'*A*x+g'*x).
    %     One can find the A and g for a particular Gaussian
    %     distribution using the function Gauss2FisherBingham.
    %
    %INPUTS: x An xDimXN set of N xDim-dimensional points on the unit
    %          sphere (magnitude must be one) at which the PDF should be
    %          evaluated. xDim>=2.
    %        A A type of inverse covariance matrix for the distribution. It
    %          must be symmetric. It does not have to be positive definite.
    %        g A real mean parameter, which need not have unit magnitude.
    %          If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
    %          then zeros will be used.
    %normConst Optionally the normalizing constant of the distribution can 
    %          be provided. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
    %          the function FisherBinghamD.normConstApprox is
    %          used to approximate it. This is offered as an option,
    %          because computing the normalizing constant can be difficult
    %          in general scenarios.
    %
    %OUTPUTS: val The value(s) of the Fisher-Bingham distribution with the
    %             specified parameters evaluated at x.
    %
    %A common formulation of the Fisher-Bingham distribution is given in
    %[1] and is the form used here. Note that definitions of A and g can
    %vary in the literature.
    %
    %For very peaky distributions, e.g. A=[1e20,0;0,1e20], the
    %normalization constant will evaluate to be numerically zero and the
    %PDF will return NaNs, except when at the mean, when Inf will be
    %returned.

    %%GAUSS2FISHERBINGHAM The Fisher-Bingham distribution comes from

    %               where c is the normalization constant found by this
    %               function, x is the random variable with unit magnitude
    %               and A and g are parameters.
    %
    %INPUTS: A A type of inverse covariance matrix for the distribution. It
    %          must be symmetric. It does not have to be positive definite.
    %          For the normalization constant, only the eigenvalues of A
    %          matter.
    %        g A real mean parameter, which need not have unit magnitude.

    %          a zero vector shall be used for g.
    %
    %OUTPUTS: c An approximation to the normalizing constant of the PDF
    %           f(x|A,g)=(1/c)*exp(-x'*A*x+g'*x)
    %
    %The second-order saddle point approximation of [1] is used. Numerically
    %computing the exact value for arbitrary A and g is actually quite
    %difficult and requires the evaluation of matrix hypergeometric
    %functions. When g=0, Newton's method is proven to be optimal in [2],
    %as the convexivity of the cost function is proven. Here, we assume
    %that the cost function is convex for a general g and use Newton's
    %method as well.
    %
    %Note that the distribution can be rewritten as
    %f(x|A,g)=(1/cp)*exp(-(1/2)*(x-gp)'*Ap*(x-gp))
    %after adjusting A and g and changing the normalziing constant. This
    %formulation more closely reflects the origin of the Fisher-Bingham
    %distribution as being a normal distribution consitioned on x having
    %unit length.

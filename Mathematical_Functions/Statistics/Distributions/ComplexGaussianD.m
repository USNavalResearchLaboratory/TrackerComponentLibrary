classdef ComplexGaussianD
%%COMPLEXGAUSSIAND Functions to hand scalar and multivariate circularly-
%                  symmetric complex Gaussian distributions.
%Implemented methods are: mean,cov, PDF, PDFI, PDFS, rand, randS
%
%When dealing with circularly-symmetric complex normal distributions, one
%must pay attention to factors of 2 and sqrt(2) that appear here and then
%and are not in real Gaussian distributions. For example, if z is a
%zero-mean scalar circularly-symmetric complex normally distributed random
%variable with variance sigma^2, then norm(z) is Rayleigh distributed
%random variable with parameter sigma/sqrt(2). This constrasts with
%sqrt(x1^2+x2^2), where x1 and x2 are independent zero mean real normal
%random variables with standard deviations sigma^2. In that instance,
%norm(z) is Rayleigh distributed random variable with parameter
%sigma.

function val=mean(mu)
%%MEAN Obtain the mean of the circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian
%      distribution.
%
%INPUTS: mu The mean of the PDF. If the PDF is multivariate, then this ia a
%           column vector.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The mean of the Gaussian distribution.
%
%The circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution is parameterized by
%its mean and covariance matrix. Thus, this function just returns the mean
%it is given.

function val=cov(Sigma)
%%COV Obtain the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution (the
%     variance if scalar).
%
%INPUTS: Sigma The variance (if scalar) or Hermitian covariance matrix (if
%              multidimensional) of the PDF. The variance cannot be zero
%              and the covariance matrix cannot be singular.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution.

function vals=PDF(z,mu,Sigma)
%%PDF Evaluate a scalar or multivariate circularly-symmetric complex
%     Gaussian (normal) PDF at a certain point given the mean and the
%     covariance matrix.
%
%INPUTS: z The points at which the PDF should be evaluated. If the PDF is
%          multivariate, then this is a column vector. If values at
%          multiple points are desired, then this is a numDimXN matrix with
%          each column being the a point (a vector).
%       mu The mean of the PDF. If the PDF is multivariate, then this is a
%          numDImX1 column vector. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%          a zero mean is used.
%    Sigma The variance (if scalar) or numDimXnumDim Hermitian covariance
%          matrix (if multidimensional) of the PDF. The variance cannot be
%          zero and the covariance matrix cannot be singular. If omitted or
%          an empty matrix is passed, the identity matrix is used as the
%          covariance matrix.
%
%OUTPUTS: vals The scalar values of the complex normal PDF with mean mu
%              and covariance matrix Sigma evaluated at the points in z. If
%              multiple points are passed (z is a matrix), then val is a
%              row vector.

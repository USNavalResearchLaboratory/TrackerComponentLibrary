%%GAMMACONJUGATEID Functions to handle the gamma conjugate type I
%          distribution. This distribution is introduced in [1] as the
%          conjugate prior to the central gamma distribution with a known
%          scale parameter when the shape parameter is being estimated.
%Implemented methods are: mean, PDF, normConst

%%MEAN Evaluate the mean of the gamma conjugate type I distribution for a
%      given set of parameters.
%
%INPUTS:    mu The parameter of the distribution that is raised to delta*x;
%              mu>0.
%        delta The parameter of the distribution that is the exponent of
%              gamma(x); delta>0. If delta is large (a few hundred), then
%              finite precision errors are likely to cause problems with
%              the numeric integration.
%    normConst Optionally the normalizing constant of the distribution can 
%              be provided. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%              the function GamconID.normConst is used to obtain it. This
%              is offered as an option, because the computation of the
%              normalizing constant requires numerical integration and can
%              be slow.
%     varargin Any parameters that should be passed to Matlab's integral
%              function to control the precision. This is generally a
%              series of text strings followed by values.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The mean of the gamma conjugate type I distribution.
%
%The distribution is described in [1]. However, there is no closed-form
%solution for the mean. Thus, the mean is computed using numerical
%integration via Matlab's integral function.

%%NORMCONST Compute the normalization cconstant for the gamma conjugate

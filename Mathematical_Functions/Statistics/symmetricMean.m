function symMean=symmetricMean(x,orders)
%%SYMMETRICMEAN Evaluate the system of polynomial functions of n numbers
%          known as a symmetric mean or the mean power product. For two
%          orders given, this is
%          (1/(n*(n-1))*sum_{i~=j}x(i)^orders(1)*x(j)^orders(2) 
%          For three orders, this continues to
%          (1/(n*(n-1)*(n-2))*sum_{i~=j~=k}x(i)^orders(1)*x(j)^orders(2)*x(k)^orders(3) 
%          and the pattern continues for higher orders. For just one order
%          given, it is the just mean(x.^orders(1)). Symmetric means arise
%          in the evlauation of k-statistics. That is, the computation of
%          unbiased central moments.
%
%INPUTS: x A length n vector of real points.
%   orders A length r vector of the orders of the exponents, n<=r.
%      
%OUTPUTS: symMean The value of the symmetric mean.
%
%This implements the formula given in [1]. For r=1, the mean value is
%explicitly found. For r>1, the problem is equivalent to computing a
%matrix permanent, so the perm algorithm is used rather than evaluating all
%binomial(n,r)*factorial(r) terms in the sum.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% x=[0, 8, -21, -13, 26, -19];
% orders=[1,3];
% symMean=symmetricMean(x,orders)
%One will get symMean=-27002.8.

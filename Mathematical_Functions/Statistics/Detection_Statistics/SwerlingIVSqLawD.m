classdef SwerlingIVSqLawD
%%SWERLINGIVSQLAWD This class implements various functions and detections
%                statistics related to the Swerling IV target model when
%                used with a square law detector. All methods are static
%                (the class holds no information and does not need to be
%                instantiated).
%
%Implemented methods are: mean, var, PDF, CDF, PD4Threshold, PD4PFA, rand
%
%Swerling models are given in [1] and in Chapter 11 of [2]. The Swerling IV
%model assumes that the observed power SNR of the target varies in terms of
%a central gamma distribution with shape parameter k=2 and scale parameter
%theta=avgSNR/2, that in a pulse train for detection the target SNR
%fluctuates from pulse to pulse, and that a square law detector is used to
%incoherently integrate multiple pulses The difference from a Swerling III
%model is the target amplitude fluctuations from pulse to pulse.
%
%The square law detector for N samples is
%y=sum_{i=1}^N r_i^2
%where r_i is the ith real amplitude. The model for the amplitude given a
%target amplitude or power is developed in Chapter 9 of [2]. The squared
%real amplitude is r^2_i=y_{I,i}^2+y_{Q,i}^2 where y_{I,i} and y_{Q,i} are
%the in-phase and quadrature components of the filter output. Define
%Rp=2*sampPowSNR, as in Equation 9.2-34. The sampled power SNR of the
%target in the Swerling IV model is different for each pulse. The sample
%power SNR is sampPowSNR=GammaD.rand(1,2,avgSNR/2) as mentioned in [1]. The
%value y=y_{I,i}+sqrt(-1)*y_{Q,i} conditioned on the sampled power SNR is
%modeled as being distributed circularly complex Gaussian with mean
%sqrt(Rp) and variance 2. (See, Equation 9.3-35a in [2]). The variance
%being 2 simply reflects having normalized the variance on the I and Q
%components each to 1.  As in Equation 10.4-13 of [2], the distribution of
%Y=y/2 conditioned on the target SNR values is noncentral chi-squared with
%a change of variables. The value y conditioned on the target SNR values is
%noncentral chi-squared with nu=2*N degrees of freedom and lambda=N*Rp as
%the noncentrality parameter. The expressions in [1] and [2] are in terms
%of Y and not y, so a transformation has to be performed to make things in
%terms of y.
%
%Under this model, for a given average power SNR value, one can generate a
%random sample from the distribution as
% sample=0;
% for curPulse=1:N
%     sampPowSNR=GammaD.rand(1,2,avgSNR/2);
%     Rp=2*sampPowSNR;%The peak power of the signal from the SNR, Equation
%                 %9.4-8 in [2].
%     A=sqrt(Rp);%Equation 9.4-8, the amplitude of the signal
%     sample=sample+sum(abs(ComplexGaussianD.rand(1,A,2)).^2);

function val=mean(avgSNR,N)
%%MEAN Obtain the mean of the distribution of the detection power
%      (normalized to a noise variance of 1) under a Swerling IV model in a
%      square-law detector.
%
%INPUTS:avgSNR The average power signal to noise ratio of the target.
%        N The number of pulses that are to be incoherently added for
%          detection (in a square-law detector). In a Swerling IV model, a
%          different realization of the target power is used across each
%          pulse and the noise corrupting the pulses varies. If this
%          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, N=1 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The value of the mean for the given parameters.
%  
%The mean is given in Equation 11.5-20 of [1] where equation 11.4-8 relates
%the parameterization used there to an average squared amplitude. To
%relate the average squared amplitude ABar^2 to avgSNR as used in [2], we
%use avgSNR=ABar^2/2. However, the first moment from that expression has to
%be multiplied by 2, because as seen in Equation 10.4-4 of [1], the
%definition is in terms of a scaled version of the square law detector.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we validate the mean by generating random samples and comparing the
%computed mean to the sample mean.

function val=PDF(x,avgSNR,N,algorithm)
%%PDF Evaluate the scalar probability density function (PDF) of the
%     distribution of the detection power (normalized to a noise variance
%     of 1) under a Swerling IV model in a square-law detector.
%
%INPUTS: x The point or points at which the PDF should be evaluated. v>=0
%          for nonzero PDF values.
%   avgSNR The average power signal to noise ratio of the target.
%        N The number of pulses that are to be incoherently added for
%          detection (in a square-law detector). In a Swerling IV model, a
%          different realization of the target power is used across each
%          pulse and the noise corrupting the pulses varies. If this
%          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, N=1 is used.
% algorithm This selects the algorithm to use. Possible values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed). Invert
%            the characteristic function in [3] using a partial fraction
%            expansion and an inverse Laplace transform. This is only
%            implemented here for the case where all pulses have the same
%            SNR.
%          1 Use an algorthm that makes use of the hypergeometric1F1
%            function. This method is slow and can be inaccurate if the
%            hypergeometric1F1 does not converge.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The values of the PDF evaluated at the given points.
%
%For algorithm 1, the PDF is given in Equation 11.5-14 where equation
%11.4-8 relates the parameterization used there to an average squared
%amplitude. To relate the average squared amplitude ABar^2 to avgSNR as
%used in [2], we use avgSNR=ABar^2/2. However the PDF is derived is based
%on a scaled square-law detector, as in Equation 10.4-4 in [1]. Thus, in
%implementing the PDF, the scaling is removed.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we validate the PDF by generating random samples and comparing the
%PDF plot with a histogram of the random samples.
% avgSNR=2;
% N=4;
% numSamples=10e3;
% 
% figure(1)
% clf
% histogram(SwerlingIVSqLawD.rand([numSamples,1],avgSNR,N),'Normalization','pdf')

% numPoints=1000;
% x=linspace(0,80,numPoints);
% vals=SwerlingIVSqLawD.PDF(x,avgSNR,N);
% plot(x,vals,'linewidth',2)
% h1=xlabel('x');
% h2=ylabel('PDF(x)');
% set(gca,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')
% set(h1,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')
% set(h2,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')
%One will see that the histogram matches well with the plot.

classdef SwerlingIISqLawD
%%SWERLINGIISQLAWD This class implements various functions and detections
%                statistics related to the Swerling II target model when
%                used with a square law detector. All methods are static
%                (the class holds no information and does not need to be
%                instantiated).
%
%Implemented methods are: mean, var, PDF, CDF, PD4Threshold, PD4PFA,
%                         avgSNR4PDThresh, avgSNR4PDPFA, thresh4AvgSNRPD,
%                         rand
%
%Swerling models are given in [1] and in Chapter 11 of [2]. The Swerling II
%model assumes that the observed power SNR of the target varies in terms of
%an exponential distribution with rate parameter (1/avgSNR), that in a
%pulse train for detection the target SNR does fluctuate from pulse to
%pulse, and that a square law detector is used to incoherently integrate
%multiple pulses. The difference from a Swerling I model is the target
%amplitude fluctuates from pulse to pulse.
%
%The square law detector for N samples is
%y=sum_{i=1}^N r_i^2
%where r_i is the ith real amplitude. The model for the amplitude given a
%target amplitude or power is developed in Chapter 9 of [2]. The squared
%real amplitude is r^2_i=y_{I,i}^2+y_{Q,i}^2 where y_{I,i} and y_{Q,i} are
%the in-phase and quadrature components of the filter output. Define
%Rp=2*sampPowSNR, as in Equation 9.2-34. The sampled power SNR of the
%target in the Swerling II model is a different random value for each
%pulse. The sample power SNR is sampPowSNR=ExponentialD.rand(1,1/avgSNR)
%as mentioned in [1]. The value y=y_{I,i}+sqrt(-1)*y_{Q,i} conditioned on
%the sampled power SNR and a phase phi is modeled as being distributed
%circularly complex Gaussian with mean sqrt(Rp)*exp(1j*phi) and variance 2.
%(See, Equation 9.3-35a in [2]). The variance being 2 simply reflects
%having normalized the variance on the I and Q components each to 1.  As in
%Equation 10.4-13 of [2], the distribution of Y=y/2 conditioned on the
%target SNR values is noncentral chi-squared with a change of variables.
%The value y conditioned on the target SNR values is noncentral chi-squared
%with nu=2*N degrees of freedom and lambda=N*Rp as the noncentrality
%parameter. The expressions in [1] and [2] are in terms of Y and not y, so
%a transformation has to be performed to make things in terms of y.
%
%Under this model, for a given average power SNR value, one can generate a
%random sample from the distribution as
% sample=0;
% for curPulse=1:N
%     sampPowSNR=ExponentialD.rand(1,1/avgSNR);
%     Rp=2*sampPowSNR;%The peak power of the signal from the SNR, Equation
%                 %9.4-8 in [2].
%     A=sqrt(Rp);%Equation 9.4-8, the amplitude of the signal
%     sample=sample+sum(abs(ComplexGaussianD.rand(1,A,2)).^2);

function val=mean(avgSNR,N)
%%MEAN Obtain the mean of the distribution of the detection power
%      (normalized to a noise variance of 1) under a Swerling II model in a
%      square-law detector.
%
%INPUTS:avgSNR The average power signal to noise ratio of the target.
%        N The number of pulses that are to be incoherently added for
%          detection (in a square-law detector). In a Swerling II model, a
%          different realization of the target power is used across each
%          pulse and the noise corrupting the pulses varies. If this
%          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, N=1 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The value of the mean for the given parameters.
%
%The expression for the mean implemented here is E{x}, where the expected
%value is taken over the PDF in Equation III.10 of [1]. However, the first
%moment from that expression has to be multiplied by 2, because as seen in
%Equation 10.4-4 of [2], the definition in [2], which is the same as in
%[1], is in terms of a scaled version of the square law detector.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we validate the mean by generating random samples and comparing the
%computed mean to the sample mean.
% avgSNR=2;
% N=4;
% numSamples=1e5;
% meanVal=SwerlingIISqLawD.mean(avgSNR,N)
% meanSampVal=mean(SwerlingIISqLawD.rand([numSamples,1],avgSNR,N))
%One will see that both mean values are about 24.

%%VAR Obtain the variance of the distribution of the detection power
%     (normalized to a noise variance of 1) under a Swerling II model in a
%     square-law detector.
%
%INPUTS:avgSNR The average power signal to noise ratio of the target.
%        N The number of pulses that are to be incoherently added for

%          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, N=1 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The value of the variance for the given parameters.
%  
%To derive the formula implemented here, the first and second noncentral
%moments were obtained by finding E{x^2} and E{x} integrating over the PDF
%in Equation III.10 in [1].  One then uses the identity that
%variance=E{x^2}-E{x}^2
%However, the variance from that expression has to be multiplied by 4,
%because as seen in Equation 10.4-4 of [2], the definition in [2], which is
%the same as the definition in [1], is in terms of a scaled version of the
%square law detector.

%Following the model of [1], a sample from the exponential distribution is
%performed to obtain the complex signal to noise ratio of every single one
%of the N pulses. Then, the square law detector output conditioned on the
%signal to noise ratio is generated directly using NonFlucSqLawD.rand for
%each pulse and the values are added.

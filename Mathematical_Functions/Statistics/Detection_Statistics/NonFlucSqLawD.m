classdef NonFlucSqLawD
%%NONFLUCMODEL This class implements various function and detection
%              statistics for targets with constant average power signal to
%              noise ratio. All methods are static (the class holds no
%              information and does not need to be instantiated).
%
%Implemented methods are: mean, var, PDF, CDF, PD4Threshold, PD4PFA, rand
%
%This model considers detection of a non-fluctuating target with a constant
%average signal power to noise ratio via non-coherent integration of
%multiple pulses in a square-law detector. The model is discussed in
%Chapter 10 of [1].
%
%In Chapter 10.4 of [1], it can be seen in Equation 10.4-13 that the PDF of
%the output of a square-law detector is related to the noncentral
%chi-square distribution. This class essentially maps the results to those
%in ChiSquareD with the appropriate parameterization.
%
%The square law detector for N samples is
%y=sum_{i=1}^N r_i^2
%where r_i is the ith real amplitude. The model for the amplitude is
%developed in Chapter 9 of [1]. The model comes from taking a sample of a
%complex amplitude coming from a filter. The squared real amplitude is
%r^2_i=y_{I,i}^2+y_{Q,i}^2 where y_{I,i} and y_{Q,i} are the in-phase and
%quadrature components of the filter output. Defining the peak power of the
%signal as Rp=2*avgSNR as in Equation 9.2-34, the value
%y=y_{I,i}+sqrt(-1)*y_{Q,i} is modeled as being distributed circularly
%complex Gaussian with mean sqrt(Rp)*exp(1j*phi), where phi is a random
%phase, and variance 2. (See, Equation 9.3-35a in [1]). The variance being
%2 simply reflects having normalized the variance on the I and Q components
%each to 1. As in Equation 10.4-13, the distribution of Y=y/2 is noncentral
%chi-squared with a change of variables. The value y is noncentral
%chi-squared with nu=2*N degrees of freedom and lambda=N*Rp as the
%noncentrality parameter.
%
%Under this model, for a given average power SNR value, one can generate a
%random sample from the distribution as
% Rp=2*avgSNR;%The peak power of the signal from the SNR, Equation 9.4-8.
% A=sqrt(Rp);%Equation 9.4-8, the amplitude of the signal
% sample=sum(abs(ComplexGaussianD.rand(N,A,2)).^2);

function val=mean(avgSNR,N)
%%MEAN Obtain the mean of the distribution of the detection power
%     (normalized to a noise variance of 1) under a constant amplitude
%     target model in a square-law detector. 
%
%INPUTS: avgSNR The average power signal to noise ratio of the target.
%        N The number of pulses that are to be incoherently added for
%          detection (in a square-law detector). In a nonfluctuating model,
%          the target power is constant and the noise corrupting the pulses
%          varies. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, N=1 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The value of the mean for the given parameters.
%
%The PDF is given by Equation 10.4-13 in [1]. However, a change of
%variables is performed to account for the values having been defined in
%terms of a scaled version of the square law in Equation 10.4-4. The final
%result is a noncentral chi-square distribution and this function just
%calls ChiSquareD.mean with the appropriate parameters.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we validate the mean by generating random samples and comparing the
%computed mean to the sample mean. 
% avgSNR=2;
% N=4;
% numSamples=1e5;
% meanVal=NonFlucSqLawD.mean(avgSNR,N)

%One will see that both values are about 24.

function PD=PD4Threshold(avgSNR,thresh,N)
%%PD4THRESHOLD Determine the detection probability of a target with a
%           constant signal to noise ratio (SNR) given the SNR and the
%           value of the detection threshold, assuming that a square-law
%           detector is used. The noise in each sample is assumed to be
%           Gaussian with variance 1 (normalized noise power).
%
%INPUTS: avgSNR A vector or matrix of average power signal to noise ratios
%               of the target at which one wishes to evaluate the detection
%               probability.
%        thresh The scalar normalized detection threshold to use. This is
%               the threshold to use if the noise variance is 1.
%             N The number of pulses that are to be incoherently added for
%               detection (in a square-law detector). In a nonfluctuating
%               model, the target power is constant and the noise
%               corrupting the pulses varies. If this parameter is omitted
%               or an empty matrix is passed, N=1 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: PD The detection probability of the target.
%
%This function implements Equations 10.4-30 in [1], which expresses the
%result in terms of an incomplete Toronto function. In [1], it is shown
%that the incomplete Toronto function parameterized T_B(m,(m-1)/2,r) is
%expressed in terms fo the MarcumQ function as
%1-MarcumQ((m+1)/2,r*sqrt(2),B*sqrt(2)). This is the form in this problem.
%Thus, the MarcumQ function is used to evaluate the detection probability.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we validate the results by comparing the PD from this function to
%the PD computed using random samples.

%
%INPUTS: NDims If NDims is a scalar, then rand returns an NDimsXNDims

%          vector, then rand returns an MXN1 matrix of random variables.

%
%OUTPUTS: vals A matrix whose dimensions are determined by N of the

%Though the random variables can be generated by summing complex Gaussian
%variables, that is not efficient for large values of N. Thus, the

function FIM=observedFisherInfo(z,RInv,h,JacobMat,HessMat)
%%OBSERVEDFISHERINFO Assuming that a linear or nonlinear measurement is
%           corrupted with zero-mean Gaussian noise, the observed Fisher
%           information matrix (FIM) has a standard form in terms of the
%           values of the measurement function and its first and second
%           derivatives. This function takes those values and returns the
%           observed FIM. Summing the FIMs from multiple simultaneous
%           independent measurements or measurement components returns the
%           observed FIM for the fused measurement. The inverse of the FIM
%           is the CramÃ©r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). If only a single
%           measurement is considered, and h=z, then h, z, and HessMat can
%           all be omitted. Usualy, there is no benefit to including the
%           terms.
%
%INPUTS: z The zDimX1 measurement, or if multiple measurements of the same
%          time are to the zDimXnumMeas matrix of those measurements. This
%          can be omitted if one just wants the FIM without this.
%     RInv The zDimXzDim inverse of the covariance matrix associated with
%          the multivariate Gaussian noise corrupting z, or if multiple
%          measurements are to be fused AND RInv differs among them, then a
%          zDimXzDimXnumMeas collection of all of the inverse matrices. If
%          z is omitted and multiple measurements are fused, then RInv MUST
%          be specified as a zDimXzDimXnumMeas matrix, not as a single
%          zDimXzDim matrix.
%        h The zDimX1 value of the xDimX1 state converted into the
%          measurement domain. If z is omitted, then this is not needed.
% JacobMat The zDimXxDim Jacobian matrix of derivatives of the measurement
%          function h taken with respect to the elements of the target
%          state. This is assumed the same for all measurements fused by
%          this function.
%  HessMat The xDimXxDimXzDim matrix of second derivatives of the
%          measurement function h with respect to the elements of the state
%          x. HessMat(i,j,k) is the Hessian for the kth measurement
%          component with derivatives taken with respect to elements i and
%          j of the x vector. i and j can be equal. Note that all
%          HessMat(:,:,k) are symmetric matrices. In 3D, the order of the
%          second derivatives in each submatrix is of the form:
%                  [d^2/(dxdx), d^2/(dxdy), d^2/(dxdz);
%                   d^2/(dydx), d^2/(dydy), d^2/(dydz);
%                   d^2/(dzdx), d^2/(dzdy), d^2/(dzdz)];
%
%OUTPUTS: FIM The xDimXxDim observed Fisher information matrix.
%
%The FIM and CRLB and in many statistics texts. When considering target
%tracking, one can look at Chapter 2.7.2 of [1]. Since no expectation is
%taken for the observed Fisher information matrix, only the form in terms
%of second derivatives in [1] can be used, not the form in terms of an
%outer product of first derivatives. The use of the inverse of the observed
%FIM in characterizing the accuracy of ML estimates is discussed in [2].
%
%The observed FIM is simply the negative of the matrix of second
%derivatives of the logarithm of the likelihood function. In the problem at
%hand:
%nabla_{x}(\nabla_x)'log(p(z|x))
%where here p(z|x)=1/sqrt(det(2*pi*R))*exp(-(1/2)*(z-h(x))'*inv(R)*(z-h(x))
%The gradient of the logarithm of the likelihood function is
%nabla_{x}log(p(z|x))=-H'*inv(R)(h(x)-z)
%where H=nabla_{x} h(x)'
%The matrix of second derivatives is thus
%nabla_{x}(\nabla_x)'log(p(z|x))=-H'*inv(R)*H-C
%where the jth column of C is given by
%C(:,j)=((\partial / \partial x_j)H')*inv(R)*(h(x)-z)
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%In this example, we consider how well the observed FIM can be used as the
%covariance matrix of a fused measurement. In this instance, with all of
%the measurement being the same accuracy, we just average the measurements
%to get a fused measurement. We then find the NEES both with and without
%using the Hessian term. It is seen that when using the Hessian term, the
%NEES is closet to 1 than when not using the Hessian term.

%EXAMPLE 2:
%In this instance, we used the observed Fisher information as a covariance
%matrix of a single spherical measurement in the absence of knowing the
%truth. Thus, we just take h(z)=z and can omit the matrix of second
%derivatives. Evaluating the NEES, one sees it is consistent (near 1, maybe
%like 0.99 or 1.001). Of course, at higher angular noise levels, a debiased
%function like spher2CartTaylor can perform better.

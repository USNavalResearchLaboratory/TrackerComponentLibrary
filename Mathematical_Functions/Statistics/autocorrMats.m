function C=autocorrMats(x,maxLag,scaling)
%%AUTOCORRMATS Compute the sample autocorrelation matrices for a given
%           (assumed zero mean) vector sequence. The sample of a sequence
%           of N vector pairs for a lag of k is
%           C(:,:,k)=x(:,(k+1):N)*x(:,1:(N-k))';
%           is unnormalized and more commonly multiplied by (1/(N-j)) for
%           the unbiased estimate. This is the vector form of computing the
%           autocorrelation of a scalar x using
%           correlation(x,x,[],'unbiased'). However, whereas the
%           "correlation" function returns a symmetric sequence (the
%           negative delay values equal to the positive ones are given),
%           this function only provides delays >=0. In tracking, the
%           compution of such autocorrelation matrices arises in covariance
%           estimation of the system, such as in [1].
%
%INPUTS: x A xDimXN matrix of N xDimX1 vectors.
%   maxLag The output is given for delays of j=0 to maxLag. maxLag can
%          range from 0 to N-1. If this parameter is omitted, the default
%          of N-1 is used.
%  scaling This optionally specifies how the output is normalized. Possible
%          values are:
%          'none'     (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed)
%                     No scaling is performed.
%          'biased'   The output C is divided by N.
%          'unbiased' The kth matrix in C is divided by N-(k-1)
%
%OUTPUTS: C The xDimXxDimXmaxLag set of autocorrelation matrices. Matrix
%           C(:,:,k) gives the value for a delay of k-1 (k starting at 1
%           going up to maxLag+1).
%
%The expression for the sample autocorrelation is given in Equation 3.6 of
%[1].
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%Here, one gets a set of 2D correlation matrices.
% x=[1,  2,   3,   4;
%   -9, -8, -16, -12];
% C=autocorrMats(x)
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here, we show that for a complex scalar sequence, the result, after
%reshaping and mirroring, is the same as the output of the function
%"correlation" when considering a 1D sequence (differences being due to
%finite precision limitiations).
% x=rand(9,1)+1j*randn(9,1);
% c=correlation(x,x,[],'unbiased');
% c1=autocorrMats(x(:).');
% c1=c1(:);
% %One will see that the following are equal, except for finite precision
% %differences.
% c(:)
% [conj(c1(end:-1:2));c1(:)]

function val=bivarNormCDF(b,mu,R)
%%BIVARNORMCDF Evaluate the cumulative density function of the bivariate
%              normal distribution with a specified mean and covariance
%              matrix. This evaluates Pr{x1<b(1), x2<b(2)) where the random
%              vector is [x1;x2].
%
%INPUTS: b A 2X1 vector [b1;b2] such that b1 is the upper bound of the
%           first variable and b2 is the upper bound on the second
%           variable.
%        mu The 2X1 mean of the distribution. If this is omitted or an
%           empty matrix is passed, then the default of [0;0] is used.
%         R The 2X2 covariance matrix of the distribution. If this is
%           omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then R=eye(2,2) is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The value of the bivariate normal CDF.
%
%This function implements the algorithm described in Section 2.3 and 2.4 of
%[1], which should be approximately accurate within the double floating
%point finite precision limits. A change of variables is used to change the
%bounds into those for the bivariate normal distribution with zero mean and
%a covariance matrix with 1s on the diagonal.

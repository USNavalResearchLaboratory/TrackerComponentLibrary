%%STRONGRUNGEKSTEPJUMP Perform a step of an explicit strong stochastic
%           Runge-Kutta method under Ito calculus for Levy processes. This 
%           integrates a d-dimensional stochastic differential equation of 
%           the form
%           dy=a(y)*dt+B(y)*dW+c(y)*dP
%           where dW is the differential of an m-dimensional Wiener
%           process and dP is a mark independent Poisson process. Strong 
%           methods converge to an optimal path as the stepsize decreases, 
%           not considering finite precision errors. These derivative free
%           methods use finite difference ratios in place of derivatives
%           in order to avoid some of the complexity involved with Taylor
%           methods (see strongStochTaylorStepJump.m). 
%           
%           Some methods below will assume assume various conditions on the
%           process (see jump commutivity, equation 7.1.6 of Chapter 7.1, 
%           page 312 of [1] and diffusion commutivity, equation 7.1.18 of 
%           Chapter 7.1, page 315 of [1]). For detailed discussion on these
%           topics, see Chapter 6.3, pages 286-289 in [1] on the jump 
%           commutivity assumption and Chapter 5.3, pages 257-258 of [1] 
%           for the diffusion commutivity assumption (you will need to see 
%           equations 5.3.1-5.3.3 in Chapter 5.3, page 252, for definitions
%           of the operators in the diffusion commutivity equation). Using 
%           these assumptions can result in significant computation time 
%           savings (in Example 3 below, the saved time in choosing method 
%           3 over method 2 is roughly 55% of the time taken to run the 
%           example using method 3). All methods below assume the jump 
%           coefficient is mark independent. This means that the value of 
%           the coefficient does not change based on how many jumps occur 
%           in a given time step (essentially imposing a piecewise constant
%           assumption on the c(y) term in the generated solution). The 
%           Poisson process intensities for all jumps are assumed to be
%           time-invariant and mark independent during the given time 
%           interval. This means that the value of the jump term 
%           coefficient does not change based on how many jumps occur in a 
%           given time step (essentially imposing a piecewise constant 
%           assumption on the c(y) term in the generated solution).
%
%INPUTS: y: The dX1 initial value of the random process.
%     aCur: The drift coefficient function which takes as input the vector
%           y and outputs a dX1 vector.
%     BCur: The diffusion coefficient function which takes as input the
%           vector y and outputs a dXm matrix where m is the number of
%           independent Wiener processes driving y.
%     cCur: The jump coefficient function which takes as input the vector y
%           and outputs a dX1 vector.
%   lambda: The frequency parameter for the Poisson distribution for a time
%           increment of 1.
%   deltaT: The time increment over which the step is taken.
% algorithm: A parameter specifying the algorithm to use. Possible values
%            are:
%            0: (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use
%               the Euler-Maruyama method from equation 6.1.27, page 277 in 
%               Chapter 6.1 of [1]. This is an order 0.5 method and does
%               not assume the diffusion or jump commutivity conditions.
%            1: Use the derivative-free order 1 scheme for the 1 dimensional
%               case with scalar noise and satisfying the jump commutivity
%               equation.
%            2: Use the derivative-free order 1 scheme for the 
%               multi-dimensional case with multi-dimensional noise and 
%               satisfying the jump commutivity equation.
%            3: Use the derivative-free order 1 scheme for the 
%               multi-dimensional case with multi-dimensional noise and 
%               satisfying the jump commutivity equation and the diffusion 
%               commutivity condition.
%   deltaP: A scalar representing the number of Poissonian jumps which have
%           occurred during the time interval. If omitted, a value is
%           generated internally.
%        W: An mXdeltaP matrix where each row corresponds to an individual 
%           Wiener process and each column corresponds to the values of the 
%           processes at the time a Poissonian jump occurs. If omitted, the
%           matrix is generated internally. It is assumed that the given
%           matrix includes the initial value at the beginning of the time
%           step in column 1, then the ordered values for each jump
%           occurring in the time interval, and finally the values at the
%           end of the time step in the last column.
%       Ts: The time at the beginning of the step. If not given, defaults
%           to 0, indicating that the Wiener process jump times will only
%           be scaled to the interval (0,deltaT].
%
%OUTPUTS: approx: The estimated value of the process after taking a step of
%                 deltaT. This is a random value.
%        drivers: A structure with members containing the driving processes
%                 used in computations. Note that not all memebers are
%                 needed for some methods and therefore are not created.
%                 Refer to the last lines of the method you are using to see
%                 which members are created. Members are:
%                 dW: (mX1) The Wiener process differences over the given
%                     time interval.
%                 dP: (scalar) The number of Poisson jumps occuring during
%                     the given time interval.
%                  W: (mXdeltaP+2) The Wiener process values used in the
%                     calculation.
%                 jT: (1XdeltaP+2) The jump times used in the calculation.
%
%EXAMPLE 1: A simple plot of several realized paths dominated by the jump
%         process. The expected value of a compound Poisson process is the
%         product of the expected number of jumps times the expected value
%         of the jump size (since these are both independent variables).
%         Here we fixed the jump size to 10 and the number of expected
%         jumps is 10*0.25 = 2.5. So the average should be around 25. 100
%         paths, with the given presets, are usually good enough to get 
%         within the interval [20,30] and takes about a second to run with
%         plotting. The variance should be the expected number of jumps
%         times the expectation of the jump size squared. Therefore, a
%         variance of 250 is expected. With the presets, the simulated
%         variance will be within [190,310] most of the time.
% 
% numpaths = 100; % Number of paths to simulate
% Tf = 10; % End time (assume start time is 0

%         X(i,n) = strongRungeKStepJump(X(i-1,n),@(x)0,@(x)1,@(x)10,0.25,dt,0);

% fprintf(strcat('The average of all %d processes is %.5f \n',...
%         'with a variance of %.5f.\n'),numpaths,avg,P);
%
%EXAMPLE 2: Comparison of path mixture statistics
% We will test that the extrapolated paths from one of the algorithms
% achieves similar mixture statistics to those generated by the exact 
% Merton model solution. This can take a couple seconds to run.
% 
%For this particular example, the order 1 derivative-free method and the 
% order 1 Taylor method in strongStochTaylorStepJump.m should return 
% similar values since the order 1 expansion of the Merton model is 
% identical for both methods as [1] notes in Chapter 7.1, page 313 
% comparing equation 7.1.9 on page 312 to equation 6.3.6 in Chapter 6.3, 
% page 287. This is due to the particular choices of diffusion and jump 
% coefficients.
% 
%The Merton model is discussed in detail in Chapter 1.7, pages 50-52 and 
% Chapter 9.6, page 414 of [1]. See equations 9.6.3 and 9.6.4 and the
% discussion on page 414. Note we simplified the jump process term's 
% coefficient to c(y)=psi*y as suggested in Chapter 7.1, page 313.

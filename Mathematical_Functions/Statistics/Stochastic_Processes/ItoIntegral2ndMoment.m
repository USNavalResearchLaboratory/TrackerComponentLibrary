function val=ItoIntegral2ndMoment(alphaIdx,betaIdx,deltaT)
%%ITOINTEGRAL2NDMOMENT Find the expected value of the product of two Ito
%                     integrals with multiple indices, specifically,
%                     val=E[I_{alphaIdx}*I_{betaIdx}]
%                     where I_{alphaIdx} is multiple Ito integrals of an
%                     argument of 1 from 0 to deltaT. The indices indicate
%                     which of multiple indices in a vector Wiener process
%                     is the measure for a given integral. An index of 0
%                     indicates that that integral is deterministic (dt not
%                     dW(i) where i is some index) This function only finds
%                     solutions where the nonzero elements of alphaIdx and
%                     betaIdx are equal and in the same order (though there
%                     can be a varying order of 0 terms between elements),
%                     which means that this function finds second moments,
%                     but not cross terms.
%
%INPUTS: alphaIdx The mX1 or 1Xm vector of indices of integration for the
%                 first Ito integral. The indices are integers >=0. 0
%                 indicates that the integral is taken over 
%         betaIdx The indices of the second Ito integral. This has the same
%                 format as alphaIdx. This must have the same number of
%                 nonzero components as alphaIdx and they must be in the
%                 same order as in alphaIdx.
%          deltaT The timespan of integration. deltaT>=0.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The real, scalar value of the desired second noncentral
%             moment.
%
%This function implements Eqautions 7.6 and 7.7 in Chapter 5.7 of [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we compare the value obtained by this function to an exact solution
%for a particular Ito Integral. In Chapter 10.4, an explicit expression for
%I_{j,j,j} is given. It is 
%I_{j,j,j}=(1/2)*((1/3)*(sqrt(deltaT)*xi)^2-deltaT)*sqrt(deltaT)*xi
%where xi is a normal random variable with zero mean and unit variance.
%Squaring that and taking the expected value, one gets
%exactSol=deltaT^3*(m2/4-m4/6+m6/36)
%where m2, m4, and m6 and the second, fourth and sixth noncentral moment of
%the normal-0-1 distribution. These are m2=1, m4=3, m6=15. Thus, the
%solution is exactSol=deltaT^3/6.
% deltaT=12;
% exactSol=deltaT^3/6
% val=ItoIntegral2ndMoment([1,1,1],[1,1,1],deltaT)
%One will see that the value returned by this function agrees with the
%exact solution, which is 288.

%%GETKALPHAPLUS Thus function can be used to find alpha+ and k(alpha) as
%               well as beta+ and k(beta) as described in Section 5.7 of
%               [1].
%
%alpha+ is just alpha without the zero elements. The first element in
%k(alpha) is the number of zero element prior to the first nonzero element.
%k(i) is then the number of zero elements between the ith and the i+1th
%nonzero component of alpha or the end of alpha.

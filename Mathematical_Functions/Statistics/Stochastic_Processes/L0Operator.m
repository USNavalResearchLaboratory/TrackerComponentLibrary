function L0=L0Operator(a,b,pfpt,pfpx,p2fpxpx)
%%L0OPERATOR This function implements the L0 operation that is used in
%         Chapter 10 of [1] as applied to a single vector or matrix
%         argument and is defined in Chapter 5.3 of [1]. This is a
%         differential operator under Ito calculus. It is:
%         L^0=partial/(partial t)+sum_{k=1}^d a(k)*partial/(partialx(k))+
%             (1/2)*sum_{k=1}^d sum_{l=1}^d sum_{j=1}^m
%                       b(k,j)*b(l,k)*partial^2/(partial x(k)*partial x(l)
%         where partial is the nabla (partial derivative) operator.
%
%INPUTS: a The dX1 drift matrix of the stochastic differential equation of
%          the form dx=a*dt+b*dW at the time under consideration, where x
%          is the value being estimated and a and b typically depend on x.
%        b The dXm diffusion matrix.
%     pfpt The d1 or d1Xd2 partial derivatives of the elements of the
%          function f (onto which the operator is being applied) with
%          respect to t.
%     pfpx The d1Xd or d1Xd2Xd partial derivatives of the elements of the
%          function f with respect to the elements of the dX1 state x.
%  p2fpxpx The d1XdXd or d1Xd2XdXd matrix of second partial derivatives of
%          the elements of f with respect to the elements of x.
%
%OUTPUTS: L0 The d1X1 or d1Xd2 (depending on dfdx) matrix that results from
%            the application of the L0 operator.

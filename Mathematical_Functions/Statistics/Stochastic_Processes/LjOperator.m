function Lj=LjOperator(b,pfpx)
%%LJOPERATOR This function implements the Lj operation that is used in
%            Chapter 10 of [1] as applied to a single vector or matrix
%            argument and is defined in Chapter 5.3 of [1]. This is a
%            differential operator under Ito calculus. It is:
%            L^j=sum_{k=1}^d b(k,j) partial/(partial x_k)
%            where partial is the nabla (partial derivative) operator. This
%            does not implement multiple Lj operators, that is L^{j1}L^{j2}
%            applied to function.
%
%INPUTS: b The dXm diffusion  matrix of the stochastic differential
%          equation of the form dx=a*dt+b*dW at the time under
%          consideration, where x is the value being estimated and a and b
%          typically depend on x.
%     pfpx The d1Xd or d1Xd2Xd matrix of partial derivatives of the
%          function to which the operator L_j is being applied with respect
%          to the elements of x.
%
%OUTPUTS: Lj A d1Xm or d1Xd2Xm (depending on pfpx) matrix that results from
%            the application of the Lj operator.

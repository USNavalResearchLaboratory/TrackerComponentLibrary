function aHiMed=weightedMedianHi(a,w,algorithm)
%WEIGHTEDMEDIANHI Compute the weighted high (upper) median. This finds the
%                 smallest value a(k) such that the sum of the weights
%                 associated with all a(i)<=a(k) is greater than half the
%                 total weight.
%
%INPUTS: a An nX1 or 1Xn real vector.
%        w A 1Xn or nX1 real vector of weights associated with the elements
%          of a. All w(i)>=0.
% algorithm An optional parameter specifying the algorithm to use. Possible
%          values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use the
%            efficient algorithm given in [1]. This is an O(n) algorithm.
%          1 Sort the values and just go through w until the cumulative
%            value of w is > wHalf. The sorting means that this will not be
%            better than O(n*log(n)).
%
%OUTPUTS: aHiMed The value of the high weighted median in a. If a contains
%                a NaN, then an empty matrix will be returned.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we demonstrate on random problems that both approaches give the same
%result. When run, the assertion should always be true (no error occur).
% numEls=50;
% numRuns=10000;
% for curRun=1:numRuns
%     a=fix(10*rand(numEls,1));
%     w=fix(10*rand(numEls,1));
%     aHiMed0=weightedMedianHi(a,w,0);
%     aHiMed1=weightedMedianHi(a,w,1);
%     assert(aHiMed0==aHiMed1)

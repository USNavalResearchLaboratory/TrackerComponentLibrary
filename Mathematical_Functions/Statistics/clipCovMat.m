function P=clipCovMat(P,minVals,maxVals,isSqrt)
%%CLIPCOVMAT Force the diagonal elements of a covariance matrix to be no
%         smaller than and no larger than certain values while still
%         keeping the matrix a valid covariance matrix. This function can
%         also be used with lower-triangular square root covariance
%         matrices. This function is useful if one wishes to set a maximum
%         value on the uncertainty in certain components of a target state
%         based on reasonable physical lower and upper bounds. For example,
%         if a target type cannot go over 100m/s, but the 99% confidence
%         region of the target covers +/-10^8 meters per second, it is
%         reasonable to shrink the region.
%
%INPUTS: P An NXNXnumMats set of numMats covariance matrices (or lower-
%          triangular square root covariance matrices if isSqrt is true).
%          If minVals is passed, then it is assumed that none of the
%          diagonal elements equals zero.
%  minVals A 1XN or NX1 vector that contains the minimum positive value
%          allowed on each diagonal element of the matrices. If only a
%          scalar is passed, then the same value is used for all N
%          dimensions. If no lower bounds are set, then an empty matrix can
%          be passed.
%  maxVals A 1XN or NX1 vector that contains the maximum positive value
%          allowed on each diagonal element of the matrices. If only a
%          scalar is passed, then the same value is used for all N
%          dimensions. If no upper bounds are set, then an empty matrix can
%          be passed. it is assumed that maxVals(i)>minVals(i).
%   isSqrt A boolean value indicating whether P holds square root
%          covariance matrices or lower-triangular square root matrices (as
%          one might get with chol using the 'lower' option). The default
%          if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false. If this is
%          true, then the returned P will also be lower-trinagular square
%          root.
%
%OUTPUTS: P The NXNXnumMats set of matrices after scaling so the diagonal
%           elements of a full covariance matrix are no larger than the
%           values in maxVals and no smaller than the values in minVals. If
%           isSqrt is false, then this is a covariance matrix. If
%           SPred(:,:,curAlg) is true, then this is a lower-triangular
%           covariance matrix.
%
%The diagonal elements of a covariance matrix are related to the largest
%rectangle that a certain uncertainty ellipsoid can be placed in. This is
%derived in Appendix A of [1].
%
%We cannot just shrink the diagonal elements without adjusting the cross
%terms or the matrix can fail to remain positive definite. It is well known
%that multiplying a random variable v by a matrix S, S*v, changes the
%covariance matrix of the random variable from P to S*P*S'. Thus, we choose
%a diagonal matrix S such that the diagonal elements of P that are too
%large are scaled to the appropriate size. One would hope that this type of
%scaling would retain reasonable covariance cross terms for a target
%tracking algorithm. Due to the scaling, this function cannot handle zero
%diagonal elements that are too small.

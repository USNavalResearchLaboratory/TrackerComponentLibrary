/**FINDFIRSTMAX Given an array of sorted vector of values in increasing
*               order, which might be full of duplicates, find the first
*               occurrence of the maximum value. An implementation in C++.
*
*INPUTS: arr A vector of values, with possible repeats, sorted in
*            increasing order.
*
*OUTPUTS: idx The index of the first occurrence of the maximum value (last)
*             element in arr.    
*
* The easiest way to find the first occurrence of the maximum value is to
* scan downward in the array from the end until a value different from the
* maximum value is found. However, that approach has a bad worst-case
* accuracy if all of the elements in the array have the same value. Thus,
* this method first checks for the easiest solutions, and then uses
* something akin to a binary search technique to find the first occurrence
* of the maximum value.
*
* The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
* CompileCLibraries function.
*
* The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
* idx=findFirstMax(arr);

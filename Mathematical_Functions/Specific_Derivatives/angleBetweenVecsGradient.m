function J=angleBetweenVecsGradient(a,s,whichVector)
%%ANGLEBETWEENVECSGRADIENT Given 3X1 vectors a and s, this finds the
%           gradient of the angle between the vectors with respect to the
%           elements of either a or s. This is the gradient of the function
%           angBetweenVecs.
%
%INPUTS: a A real 3X1 vector.
%        s A real 3X1 vector.
% whichVector If this is 0, then the gradient is taken with respect to the
%          elements of a. If this is 1, then the gradient is taken with
%          respect to the elements of s. The default if omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passed is 1.
%
%OUTPUTS: J A 1X3 vector where J(i) is the derivative of the angle with
%           respect to the ith element of the selected vector (a or s).
%
%This implements the gradient of the cross-product relation used in
%the angBetweenVecs function.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%The maximum absolute relative error between a gradient obtained with
%numerical differentiation and one obtained from this function is computed.
%The error is on the order of what one might expect due to finite precision
%limitiation.

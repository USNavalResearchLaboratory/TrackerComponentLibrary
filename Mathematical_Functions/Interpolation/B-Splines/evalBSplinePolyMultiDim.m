function val=evalBSplinePolyMultiDim(t,tLength,x,k,idx)
%%EVALBSPLINEPOLYMULTIDIM Given a set of knots and a multidimensional
%           point, evaluate the multivariate b-spline weight. This is just
%           the product of univariate B-spline weights. Unlike the function
%           evalBSplinePolysMultiDim, this function can handle values of x
%           that are outside of the region
%           t(idx+-1k,curDim)<=x(curDim)<=t(idx+k,curDim) in any dimension.
%
%INPUTS: t The maxNumKnotsXnumDims set of knots for the interpolation
%          function. These are actually the values in each coordinate
%          dimension given in ascending order. The full knots are implied
%          [t1,t2,etc.]=ndgrid(t(1:tLengths(1),1),t(1:tLengths(2),2),...)
%          and the dimensions can be put together into the full set of
%          numDimsXtotalNumPoints points as tTotal=[t1(:).';t2(:).';...].
%          The first and last k(curDim)-1 knots in each dimension are
%          outside of the ends of the region with data or mark the ends of
%          the region with data. The number of rows is the maximum number
%          needed for all of the dimensions. tLength says how many items
%          in each column are actually used.
%  tLength A numDimX1 vector where tLength(i) says the number of elements
%          in t(:,i).
%        x The numDimXnumPoints set of points where one wishes to evaluate
%          the multivariate b-spline weight.
%        k A numDimsX1 or 1XnumDims set of the order of the b-splines in
%          each dimension. The value k-1 is the polynomial order of the
%          approximation being performed. If the order is the same in all
%          dimensions, then a single scalar can be passed.
%      idx This input specifies where in terms of the knots the B-spline
%          polynomials are centered. This is a numDimX1 integer value
%          where the ith dimension ranges from 1 to tLength(i)-k.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The value of the multivariate b-spline evaluated at all of
%             the points in x. This has the same number of columns as x.
%
%Chapter 17 of [1] discusses tensor product splines. This function just
%takes the product of the output of the evalBSplinePoly(t,x,k,idx) across
%multiple dimensions.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% k=[5;5];
% t=[-1.5000,-1.5000;
%    -1.5000,-1.5000;
%    -1.5000,-1.5000;
%    -1.5000,-1.5000;
%    -1.5000,-1.5000;
%    -0.6667,-0.7500;
%    -0.3333,-0.4500;
%          0,-0.1500;
%     0.3333, 0.1500;
%     0.6667, 0.4500;
%     1.5000, 0.7500;
%     1.5000, 1.5000;
%     1.5000, 1.5000;
%     1.5000, 1.5000;
%     1.5000, 1.5000;
%          0, 1.5000];
% tLength=[15;16];
% idx=[6;6];
% x=[0;0];
% val=evalBSplinePolyMultiDim(t,tLength,x,k,idx)
%One will get val=0.281332214065824;

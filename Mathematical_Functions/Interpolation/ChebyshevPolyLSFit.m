function a=ChebyshevPolyLSFit(tauList,n,fList,dfList,w)
%%CHEBYSHEVPOLYLSFIT  Find the weights for a series of Chebyshev
%                     polynomials of the first kind to best fit data given
%                     at a number of discrete, scalar points, constrained
%                     such that the values at the endpoints are perfectly
%                     met. If desired, derivatives can also be added to the
%                     least squares problem, whereby the derivatives at the
%                     endpoints are perfectly matched.
%
%INPUTS: tauList An NX1 or 1XN set of points for which the interpolation
%                weights should be found. tauList should be sorted in
%                increasing order.
%              n The non-negative integer maximum order of the
%                highest-order Chebyshev polynomial in the expansion.
%          fList The function to be interpolated at the values of tauList.
%         dfList An optional set of derivatives of the function to be
%                interpolated evaluated at the points in tauList.
%              w If dfList is provided, one can optionally provide w, which
%                is a 2X1 or 1X2 weighting vector, where w(1) is the
%                weighting for the squared function errors and w(2) is the
%                weighting for the squared derivative errors. Different
%                weightings can be useful in the least squared problem,
%                because the function and its derivative will typically
%                span different domains.
%
%OUTPUTS: a A set of weights that can be used with the function
%           ChebyshevPolySynth(tau,a,tauStart,tauEnd) to interpolate a
%           point tau, where tauStart=tauList(1) and tauEnd=tauList(end)
%           and the points tau is within the starting and ending bounds.
%
%The algorithm implemented is taken from [1]. There it is suggested that
%when performing least squares Chebyshev polynomial fitting with
%ephemerides, one use w(1)=1 and w(2)=0.16.

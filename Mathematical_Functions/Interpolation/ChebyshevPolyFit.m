function a=ChebyshevPolyFit(f,n,tauStart,tauEnd)
%%CHEBYSHEVPOLYFIT Get weights to fit a series of Chebyshev polynomials of
%                  the first kind to a function f over the range of values
%                  tauStart,tauEnd. The coefficients can be used with the
%                  function ChebyshevPolySynth to interpolate the
%                  function. Fitted Chebyshev polynomials are a good
%                  approximation to a minimax polynomial fit. In such an
%                  instance, one generally chooses n notably larger than
%                  desired, and then truncates the resulting coefficient
%                  set.
%
%INPUTS: f A function handle to a scalar function that can be passed
%          vectors of points at which it is to be evaluated for
%          interpolation. The function will not be evaluated at the
%          endpoints.
%        n The maximum order of the polynomials to generate. There will be
%          n+1 returned coefficients, because there is a 0 order
%          polynomial.
% tauStart,tauEnd The range of the f over which fiting for interpolation is
%          to be taken. If omitted, a range of -1 to 1 is assumed. This is
%          the normal range for Chebyshev polynomials.
%
%OUTPUTS: a An (n+1)X1 or 1X(n+1) vector of the coefficients for the
%           Chebyshev polynomials from degree 0 to degree n. This can be
%           used with the function ChebyshevPolySynth for interpolation.
%
%The coefficients are deterministically found by evaluating the function f
%at a predictable set of points based on the Chebyshev Approximation
%Formula that is mentioned in [1]. At each of the points chosen for
%evaluation, which are the zeros of the highest-order Chebyshev polynomial,
%the function is matched exactly.
%
%The discrete costine transform was used to implement the sum in a
%computationally efficient manner.

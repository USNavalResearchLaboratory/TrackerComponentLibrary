function [a,c]=HermiteInterpMultiPoly(x,y,numDims)
%%HERMITEINTERPMULTIPOLYS Given a multidimensional function y(x) evaluated
%             a certain values of x (control points) along with an
%             arbitrary number of derivatives of y(x) at those points, this
%             function returns the coefficients of the Hermite
%             interpolating polynomials fitting those points across all
%             dimensions. This function differs from
%             findHermiteInterpPolySet in that this function tries to find
%             one high-order Hermite interpolation polynomial for each
%             dimension that matches all of the points given, whereas
%             findHermiteInterpPolySet finds a set of low-order
%             polynomials, which is more practical for large regions as
%             finite precision errors can dominate this function. Compare
%             this to the function HermiteInterpPoly, which can only handle
%             scalar values.
%
%INPUTS: x An NpX1 or 1XNp vector of real, scalar values at which the
%          function y and its derivative are given. The values are assumed
%          to be given in increasing order without duplicates. Np>=2.
%        y A (numMoments*numDims)XNp matrix of values of the
%          multidimensional function y(x) and its derivatives evaluated at
%          the points in x. All values for a particular derivative are
%          given before any of the next derivative. For example, to
%          interpolate in 3D position and velocity, the ordering would be
%          [x;y;z;xDot;yDot;zDot].
%  numDims The scalar number of dimensions present. This will typically be
%          2 or 3 when dealing with target states. If this parameter is
%          omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then numDims=1 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: a The numDimsXnumCoeff matrix of the interpolating polynomial
%           coefficients for each dimension and moment. This and the
%           next output can be used in the function polyValNewton to
%           interpolate values.
%         c The numDimsX(numCoeff-1) matrix of control points for the
%           interpolating polynomials.
%
%Multivariate Hermite interpolation is duscussed in [1]. This function
%calls HermiteInterpPoly for each of the dimensions present and stacks the
%results by dimension.

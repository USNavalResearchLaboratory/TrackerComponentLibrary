function yInterp=HermiteSetInterpVal(pInterp,a,c,xRange,numDerivs)
%%HERMITESETINTERPVAL Given a set of interpolating polynomial coefficients
%           a and control points c for Hermite interpolation from the
%           function findHermiteInterpPolySet, this function evaluates the
%           interpolated values at the points in pInterp.
%
%INPUTS: pInterp A numPointsX1 or 1XnumPoints set of points at which the
%           interpolated values are desired.
%         a The numDimsXnumCoeffXnumInterpRegions
%           hypermatrix of the interpolating polynomial coefficients for
%           each dimension, moment, and region. This and the following two
%           other inputs can be obtained using the findHermiteInterpPolySet
%           function.
%         c The (numDims*numMoments2Interp)X(numCoeff-1)XnumInterpRegions
%           hypermatrix of control points for the interpolating
%           polynomials.
%    xRange The length (numInterpRegions+1) vector of boundary points of
%           the interpolating regions.
% numDerivs The number of derivatives to interpolate. A value of zero means
%           only interpolate position. 1 means velocity, 2 acceleration,
%           etc.
%
%OUTPUTS: yInterp The (numDims*(numDerivs+1))XnumPoints set of interpolated
%                 state values at the given points. All dimensions for a
%                 particular derivative value are given before later ones.
%                 for example, for position and velocity in 3D, the
%                 ordering is [x;y;z;xDot;yDot;zDot].
%
%Hermite interpolation is discussed in Chapter 2 of 1[]. This function uses
%binSearch on each point to find the region in xRange indicating which
%values in a and c to use for the interpolation. The function then performs
%interpolation using multiple calls to polyValNewton. See the sample code
%in the comments to findHermiteInterpPolySet for an example of how this
%function is used.

function [a,c]=HermiteInterpPoly(x,y)
%%HERMITEINTERPPOL Given a scalar function y(x) evaluated at certain
%                  values of x (control points) along with an arbitrary
%                  number of derivatives of y(x) at those points, this
%                  function returns the coefficients of the Hermite
%                  interpolating polynomial. If a large number of control
%                  points is used, then numerical precision problems can
%                  lead to bad results. In general, exceeding about 15
%                  control points can lead to a loss of precision.
%
%INPUTS: x An NpX1 or 1XNp vector of values at which the function y and its
%          derivative are given. The values are assumed to be given in
%          increasing order without duplicates.
%        y A numMatchXNp matrix of values of the function y(x) and its
%          derivatives evaluated at values of the points in x. y(row,col)
%          corresponds to the row-1 derivative of y evaluated at x(col).
%
%OUTPUTS: a Coefficients of the interpolating polynomial of y in Newton
%           form as a ROW vector (1XnumCoeff). The interpolating polynomial
%           can be evaluated at a desired point using the function
%           polyValNewton with a and the c point vector. By stacking
%           multiple row vectors, one can use the function polyValNewton to
%           evaluate multiple polynomials at the same time (i.e for vector
%           valued functions).
%         c Control points for the interpolating polynomial of y in Newton
%           form as a 1X(numCoeff-1) row vector.
%
%Note that the function call
%aPower=convertPolynomialForm('Newton','PowerSeries',a,c);
%can convert a and c into power series (for use with the polyval function).
%However, a loss of precision will occur and some interpolation problems
%that would work very well in Newton's form might produce very bad results.
%
%The interpolating polynomial matches all values of y and its derivatives
%at the control points in x. Newton's form of a polynomial evaluated at the
%point z is
%y(z)=a(1)+sum_{k=1}^{n-1}a(k+1)(z-c(1))*(z-c(2))*...*(z-c(k))
%
%The algorithm is an implementation of the Chapter 2.1.5 of [1], where a
%general divided difference algorithm is discussed. In Section 2.1.3 of
%[1], it is mentioned that the error in the Newton polynomial solution can
%be reduced by ordering the coefficients in a certain manner. As long as
%the number of points to match is kept small, that is not necessary.
%
%If that is difficult to understand, one might want to start with Chapter
%3.4 of [2], which describes the basic algorithm only for matching the
%position and the first derivative.
%
%Often it is best to perform interpolation just between a few points at a
%time to avoid  wild fluctuations of the fitted polynomial that can result
%when many points are used and finite precision errors will increase.

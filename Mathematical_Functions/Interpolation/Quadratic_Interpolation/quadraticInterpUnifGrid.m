function yInterp=quadraticInterpUnifGrid(xDes,x0,deltaX,yPts)
%%QUADRATICINTERPUNIFGRID Given a set of function values evalauted at
%       uniformly spaced points, interpolate the function values at a set
%       of desired points using quadratic interpolation. This function
%       selects the nearest set of basis points for the interpolation of
%       each point given the values in xPts and yPts.
%
%INPUTS: xDes A vector or matrix of real values of the independent variable
%             at which interpolation should be performed.
%          x0 The value of the independent variable at which yPts(1) was
%             evaluated.
%      deltaX The spacing of the independent variable  between values of
%             the dependent variable in yPts. deltaX>0.
%        yPts A numBasisX1 or 1XnumBasis array of values of the real
%             function to be interpolated evaluated starting with argument
%             at x0 and continuing with increments of deltaX. numBasis>=3.
%
%OUTPUTS: yInterp The interpolated values. This matrix has the same
%                 dimensions as xDes.
%
%This function finds brackets the region for each point using binSearch
%and then performs interpolation using quadraticInterpUnif3Pt.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%A sine wave is plotted in blue. Then, a small set of points for
%interpolation are chosen. The line is then interpolated between the points
%and plotted in red. One can see the discontinuities when the basis points
%for the quadratic interpolation change. Increasing the number of basis
%points can decrease the discontinuity.

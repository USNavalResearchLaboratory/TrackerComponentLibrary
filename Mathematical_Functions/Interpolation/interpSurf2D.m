function [zInterp,gradInterp,gradDerivMatInterp]=interpSurf2D(xyPoints,xyPointsRef,zPointsRef,smoothTerm)
%%INTERPSURF2D Given a set of values zPointsRef at the 2D points
%              xyPointsRef that define a surface, interpolate to the
%              points given in xyPoints and evaluate the interpolated z-
%              value, the gradient, and the partial derivatives of the
%              interpolated gradient at the points. For large numbers of
%              points, b-splines will be more efficient than this approach.
%
%INPUTS: xyPoints A 2XN set of N 2D (x,y) points at which interpolation and
%                 gradients are desired.
%     xyPointsRef The 2XnumRef set of numRef (x,y) points in two-dimensions
%                 that define the locations at which the zPointsRef
%                 (surface heights) are provided. There should be no
%                 repeated (or very numerically close) points and the
%                 points should not all be collinear/ nearly collinear.
%      zPointsRef The numRefX1 or 1XnumRef set of heights at the reference
%                 points xyPointsRef.
%      smoothTerm An optional positive term that afects how smooth the
%                 interpolated surface is. Higher values make the surface
%                 smoother. If omitted, a default value of 0 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: zInterp The NX1 vector of interpolated z value at the points
%                 given in xyPoints.
%      gradInterp The 2XnumRef gradients of the interpolated surface
%                 evaluated at the points in xyPoints.
% gradDerivMatInterp The 2X2XnumRef second derivative matrices of the
%                 interpolated surface at the points of interest.
%
%The 2D surface from which the derivatives are derived is found using the
%hyperbolic multiquadratic method. The algorithm is cited to originate in
%[1]. However, that paper was not consulted in implementing the routine.
%Rather the summaries given in [2] and [3] where the routine is compared to
%a number of other algorithms were used.
%
%None of those methods explicitly provides the derivatives, but analytic
%derivatives for the interpolating function are simple to find.
%The interpolating function is
%fInterp(x,y)=sum_{i=1}^{numRef} c_i sqrt((x-x_i)^2+(y-y_i)^2+smoothTerm)
%Where the x_i and y_i are the refernce points and the c_i terms are found
%by solving numRef linear equations so that the interpolation equation
%matches the points at points in zPointsRef at the reference x and y
%values.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%This example shows that the interpolated surface looks smooth, as one would
%expect.
% %Get a surface.
% [X,Y,Z]=peaks(25);
% %Plot the surface
% figure(1)
% clf
% surface(X,Y,Z,'EdgeColor','none');
% %The surface consists of 25 points spanning +/-3 in x and y.
% %Formulate the reference points for the inputs for interpSurf2D 
% xyPointsRef=[X(:)';Y(:)'];
% zPointsRef=Z(:);
% %We would like to first make sure that the interpolated points are not
% %terrible. To do that, we will evaluate points on a finer grid and make
% %sure that the plot does not look messed up.
% numPoints=200;
% points=linspace(-3,3,numPoints);
% [XInterp,YInterp]=meshgrid(points,points);
% xyPoints=[XInterp(:)';YInterp(:)'];
% zInterp=interpSurf2D(xyPoints,xyPointsRef,zPointsRef);
% 
% figure(2)
% clf
% surface(XInterp,YInterp,reshape(zInterp,numPoints,numPoints),'EdgeColor','none');
%The interpolated plot looks very smooth.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%This uses the same surface as in example 1, but here we validate the
%gradient vectors by integrating across the surface from one point to
%another and seeing if the values match. This example uses a subroutine
%called integrateFunc, which is given.
% [X,Y,Z]=peaks(25);
% xyPointsRef=[X(:)';Y(:)'];
% zPointsRef=Z(:);
% %Let's integrate from a corner to the peak.
% x0=xyPointsRef(:,1);
% [~,maxIdx]=max(zPointsRef);
% x1=xyPointsRef(:,maxIdx);
% 
% display('The initial height is')
% zPointsRef(1)
% display('The true end height is')
% zPointsRef(maxIdx)
% display('The height obtained by evaluating the gradient line integral is')
% integral(@integrateFunc,0,1,'RelTol',1e-10)
% 
% function vals=integrateFunc(tVals)
%     vals=zeros(size(tVals));%Allocate space;
%     numVals=length(tVals(:));
% 
%     xyPointsCur=zeros(2,numVals);
%     for curPoint=1:numVals
%        xyPointsCur(:,curPoint)=x0+(x1-x0)*tVals(curPoint); 
%     end
% 
%     [~,gradVals]=interpSurf2D(xyPointsCur,xyPointsRef,zPointsRef);
% 
%     for curVal=1:numVals
%         vals(curVal)=gradVals(:,curVal)'*(x1-x0);
%     end

function pInterp=spherLinInterp(u,p1,p2,normalize)
%%SPHERLININTERP Perform spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) between two
%                vectors at a number of points. SLERP is useful for
%                obtaining a smooth interpolation between two 3D directions
%                as unit vectors or between two orientations, represented
%                in 4D using  quaternions. The interpolation is performed
%                the short way on the sphere between the vectors. However,
%                note that with quaternions q and -q represent the same
%                orientation, thus if the last elements of the quaternions
%                have opposite signs, then the rotation will be the long
%                way. The interpolation routine can also be used with non-
%                unit vectors.
%
%INPUTS: u  A 1XN or NX1 vector of the n points at which interpolation
%           should be performed. These are values from 0 to 1 that
%           interpolate along the way from p1 to p2.
%     p1,p2 The pDimX1 starting and ending interpolation points. This are
%           typically 3D for directions and 4D for interpolating
%           orientations via quaternions. They do not have to be unit
%           vectors. pDim>=2.
% normalize An optional parameter indicating whether the output pInterp
%           should be normalized. If p1 and p2 have the same magnitude,
%           then barring finite precision problems, normalization is not
%           necessary, because the output will have the same magnitude as
%           the inputs. The default if this parameter is omitted or an
%           empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: pInterp A pDimXn matrix of the vectors interpolated at the N
%                 fractions given in u.
%
%The interpolation path is a constant-velocity torque-minimal path, making
%it an interpolation method consistent with physics when considering
%rotations. The SLERP algorithm originates in [1] in the "great arc
%in-betweening" section.
%
%Note that spherLinInterp2Pt(u,p1,p2) equals spherLinInterp2Pt(1-u,p2,p1),
%as one would expect.

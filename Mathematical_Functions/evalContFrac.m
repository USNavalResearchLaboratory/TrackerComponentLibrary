function f=evalContFrac(bFunc,aFunc,tinyVal,maxIter)
%%EVALCONTFRAC Evaluate a continued fraction of the form
%              f=b(1)+a(1)/(b(2)+a(2)/(b(3)+a(3)/(b(4)+a(4)/...
%              Given either matrices for a finite number of a and b terms
%              of function for the a and b values such that the required
%              number of terms can be requested.
%
%INPUTS: bFunc This can either be a function such that bFunc(i) provides
%              b(i) in the continued fraction, or this can be a maxNX1 or
%              1XmaxN vector of explicit b values.
%        aFunc This has to be of the same type as bFunc, either a function
%              handle or a vector to provide the a values. If a vector,
%              then it is 1X(maxN-1) or (maxN-1)X1 as it takes one fewer
%              call to the a terms than the b terms to evaluate the
%              continued fraction.
%      tinyVal An optional parameter that is less than typical values of
%              eps(b), but is not zero. This parameter is used to mitigate
%              divide-by zero errors. The default if this parameter is
%              omitted or an empty matrix is passed if 2e-100.
%      maxIter An optional parameter considering the maximum number of
%              terms to evaluate in the continued fraction. The default
%              value if omitted is 1000. This parameter is only used if
%              aFunc and bFunc are functions, not arrays. If they are
%              arrays, then the maximum number of terms used is determined
%              by the array length.
%
%OUTPUTS: f The value of the continued fraction. The smallest possible
%           value that this can take if b(0)=0 and all a and b are
%           non-negative is eps, due to how the function is initialized to
%           be numerically robust.
%
%The algorithm is the modified Lentz's method. A good description of the
%method, demonstrating its origin is given in Chapter II and Appendix C of
%[1]. The origin of the algorithm is [2]. However, the algorithm is harder
%to understand outside of the context of Bessel functions when consulting
%[2].
%
%An example of a continued fraction is an approximation to pi:
% bFunc=@(i)((i==1)*0+(i~=1)*(2*(i-1)-1));
% aFunc=@(i)(4*(i==1)+(i-1)^2*(i~=1));
% piApprox=evalContFrac(bFunc,aFunc)

function [C,selDims]=compressNonSelDims(C,selDims,justDims)
%%COMPRESSNONSELDIMS Given a hypermatrix, reduce the number of dimensions
%       keeping the selected dimensions as distinct dimensions. For
%       example, if selDim=3, then a matrix of the form
%       C(:,:,selDim,:,:,:) (where we marked the selected dimensions), will
%       be reduced to the form C(:,selDim,:).
%
%INPUTS: C An S-dimensional matrix or, if justDims=true, size(C).
%  selDims A vector holding the indices of which dimensions of S should be
%          preserved. Alternatively, this could be a length-S boolean
%          vector where selDims(i) specifies whether the ith dimension of C
%          is fixed. If this is a boolean vector, then islogical(selDims)
%          must be true. If this is not a boolean vector, then
%          islogical(selDims) must be false.
% justDims An optional parameter specifying what the first input is. If
%          justDims=true, then instead of passing C, one is passing size(C)
%          and the C output is empty. The default if omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: C The input matrix reshaped such that non-selected dimensions are
%           compressed as much as possible. Note that the ordering of the
%           elements in C does not change; just the dimensions of C. If
%           justDims=true, then this will be size(C).
%   selDims This indicates which of the compressed dimensions correspond to
%           the original uncompressed dimensions. If selDims on the input
%           is an array of indices, then this will be an array of indices.
%           If selDims on the input was sorted in ascending order, then
%           selDims(i) is the dimension of C to which the ith index
%           originally passed on the input corresponds. If selDims on the
%           input was a boolean vector, then this is a boolean vector
%           indicating which of the compressed indices are fixed.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% C=randn(12,26,36,13,18,9,6);
% selDims=[1;2;5;7];
% [C,newSelDims]=compressNonSelDims(C,selDims);
% size(C)
% newSelDims
%It will compress the third and fourth dimensions. The final size will thus
%be [12, 26, 468, 18, 9, 6] and newSelDims=[1;2;4;6];

function F=expMat(A,algorithm)
%%EXPMAT Evaluate the matrix exponential of a particular matrix nXn A. This
%       is most easily defined in terms of the Taylor series expansion:
%       exp(A)=eye(n)+A+A*A/factorial(2)+A*A*A/factorial(3)+...
%       The inverse of the function is logMat.
%
%INPUTS: A An nXn real or complex matrix.
% algorithm An optional parameter specifying how to compute the matrix
%          exponential. Possible values are:
%          0 Use Algorithm 9.3.1 or Chapter 9.3.1 of [1]. This is the Pade
%            approximation method.
%          1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use the
%            Schur-Parlett method from Chapter 9.3.1 of [1] method via the
%            function SchurMatFunEval.
%
%OUTPUTS: F The matrix exponential of A.

%%JOINTEIG Given K NXN real matrices that are not defective, try to find a
%          set of joint eigenvectors. That is find A such that
%          inv(A)*M(:,:,k)*A is a diagonal matrix for all k. Because such
%          solutions cannot be found exactly for general matrices, a
%          minimization of the sum of the squared Frobenius norms of the
%          matrices E_k=inv(A)*M(:,:,k)*A after zeroing the diagonal
%          elements is performed.
%
%INPUTS: M An NXNXK set of K NXN real, non-defective matrices.
%  maxIter The maximum number of iterations to try to perform. The default
%          if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is 500.
%
%OUTPUTS: A The approximate NXN matrix of joint eigenvectors. 
%        CB The value of the pentalty term at termination.
%  exitCode A value indicating how the algorithm exited. Possible values
%           are:
%           0 The algorithm converged.
%           1 The maximum number of iterations was reached.
%           
%This implements the algorithm of [1]. Note that a matrix is considered
%defective if it does not have a complete basis of eigenvectors and is thus
%not diagonalizable. This type of joint eigenvalue decomposition arises in
%some independent component analysis (ICA) techniques.
%
%If CB is the cost (sum of Frobenius norm squared of off-diagonal elements
%of the approximately diaognalized matrices), and CBPrev is the cost at the
%previous iteration, then convergence is determined when
%abs(CB-prevCost)<=prevCost*eps()
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%Here we get an exact solution for two matrices when there exists an exact
%common set of eigenvectors.
% C1=[87, 25, 18, 31;
%     25, 63, 20, 17;
%     18, 20, 65, 29;
%     31, 17, 29, 65];
% [V,D]=eig(C1);
% C2=V*diag([1;2;3;-10])*inv(V);
% M=zeros(4,4,2);
% M(:,:,1)=C1;
% M(:,:,2)=C2;
% [A,CB,exitCode]=jointEig(M)
% %Verify that the solutions are diagonal.
% inv(A)*C1*A
% inv(A)*C2*A
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here, we perturb the matrices with some noise and see that reasonable
%diagonalization is still possible.
% C1=[87, 25, 18, 31;
%     25, 63, 20, 17;
%     18, 20, 65, 29;
%     31, 17, 29, 65];
% [V,D]=eig(C1);
% C2=V*diag([1;2;3;-10])*inv(V);
% C1=C1+1e-3*randn(4,4);
% C2=C2+1e-3*randn(4,4);
% M=zeros(4,4,2);
% M(:,:,1)=C1;
% M(:,:,2)=C2;
% [A,CB,exitCode]=jointEig(M)
% %Verify that the solutions are approximately diagonal desite the noise.
% inv(A)*C1*A
% inv(A)*C2*A

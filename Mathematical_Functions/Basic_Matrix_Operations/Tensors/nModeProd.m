function Y=nModeProd(X,U,n)
%%NMODEPROD Given a real or complex N-mode tensor A, whose dimensions are
%           I_1XI_2...XI_N, and a JXI_n matrix U, compute the n-mode
%           matrix product of the tensor and the matrix.
%           
%INPUTS: X The hypermatrix (tensor) that is to be involved in the n-mode
%          product. This should have 2 or more modes. For example, a
%          4-mode hyper matrix would be addressable as X(i1,i2,i3,i4).
%          The hypermatrix can be real or complex.
%        U The matrix by which the tensor is to be multiplied. The
%          dimensionality of the matrix is JXI_n, where J can be any
%          positive integer, but I_n has to match the  dimensionality of
%          the nth mode of X.
%        n The integer mode over which the multiplication is to be
%          performed. This ranges from 1 to N, the number of modes in X.
%
%OUTPUTS: Y The n-mode product of X and U. This has size
%           I_1 X...XI_{n-1} X J X I_{n+1} X... XI_N. That is, it has as
%           many modes as X, but the dimensionality of the nth mode has
%           changed to J.
%
%The n-mode product of tensors is defined in [1] and [2]. The
%implementation is using the tensor to matrix conversions as described in
%[3].
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
% X(:,:,1)=[1,4,7,10;
%           2,5,8,11;
%           3,6,9,12];
%       
% X(:,:,2)=[13,16,19,22;
%           14,17,20,23;
%           15,18,21,24];
% U=[1,3,5;
%    2,4,6];
% n=1;
% Y=nModeProd(X,U,n)
%Would produce the results
% Y(:,:,1)=[22    49    76   103;
%           28    64   100   136];
% Y(:,:,2)=[130   157   184   211;
%           172   208   244   280]
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%This is the same as Example 3.5 in [2]. We have an orthonormal matrix
%(C'*C=eye(2,2)), and we multiply and then rerecover the original vector
%demonstrating  that for an orthonormal matrix C, that
%X=nModeProd(Y,C,n) can be reversed as Y=nModeProd(X,C',n)
% Y(:,:,1)=[1,4,7,10;
%           2,5,8,11;
%           3,6,9,12];
% Y(:,:,2)=[13,16,19,22;
%           14,17,20,23;
%           15,18,21,24];
% C=[0.58,0;
%    0.58,-0.71;
%    0.58,0.71];
% C(:,1)=C(:,1)/norm(C(:,1));
% C(:,2)=C(:,2)/norm(C(:,2));
% X=nModeProd(Y,C,3);
% Z=nModeProd(X,C',3);
% max(abs(Z(:)-Y(:)))
%One will see that Z and Y are equal within reasonable finite precision
%bounds.

function y=solveYuleWalker(r,b)
%%SOLVEYULEWALKER Solve the Yule-Walker equation (for real values) as
%          formulated using correlation coefficients or the general Yule-
%          Walker equation. For the Yule-Walker equation, given a real
%          positive definite Topeplitz matrix T=toeplitz([r(1:(n-1))]),
%          solve the system T*y=-r(2:n). For the general Yule-Walker
%          equation, given a real Toeplitz matrix T=toeplitz(r(1:(n-1))),
%          solve the system T*y=b. This function scales better for large
%          matrices than does matrix inversion.
%
%INPUTS: r When solving the Yule-Walker equation, r is a real nX1 or 1Xn
%          vector defining a Toeplitz matrix such that
%          toeplitz([1;r(1:n-1)]) is positive definite. When solving the
%          general Yule-Walker equation, r is an (n-1)X1 or 1X(n-1) vector
%          with similar requirements for the Toeplitz matrix.
%        b If this parameter is provided and is not an empty matrix, then
%          the system being solved is T*y=b with T=toeplitz(r).
%
%OUTPUTS: y The real solution to the system T*y=-r(:) or T*y=b.
%
%If b is not provided, this uses Durbin's algorithm, which is Algorithm
%4.7.1 in Chapter 4.7.3 of [1]. If b is provided, this uses Levinson's
%algorithm, which is Algorithm 4.7.2 in Chapter 4.7.4 of [1]. The
%algorithms are provided assuming that r(1)=1. Thus, the first step of both
%procedures is to scale everything and remove r(1).
%
%The Yule-Walker equation as solved here arises in parameter estimation for
%autoregressive systems when parameterized with correlation coefficients.
%This is described in Chapter 1.8 of [2]. Given samples of data, such
%correlation coefficients might be found using the correlation function
%with the 'unbiased' option, which is essentially what is done in an
%example in Chapter 3.3. of [2]. For a parameterization in terms of raw
%data and not correlation coefficients, consider the function
%solveAutoRegressiveSys.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This demonstrates that the results are consistent with building the full
%Toeplitz matrix and using a matrix inverse to solve the problem. The
%relative error for this small problem is on the order of finite precision
%limitations.

function [A,idxList]=quickSort(A,byCol,gtCompareFunc)
%%QUICKSORT Sort an array, a matrix, or a cell array in ascending order
%           using a non-recursive implementation of the quicksort
%           algorithm. The quicksort algorithm tends to have better average
%           performance than other techniques, being O(n*log(n)) averge and
%           best case, with a small multiplicative constant, but has O(n^2)
%           worst case performance, which is worse than heapsort.  A custom
%           comparison function can be used so that one can, for example,
%           sort strings or other things. Changing the direction of the
%           comparison function (from greater than to less than) changes
%           the sorting order from ascending to descending. Note that
%           quickSort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that the
%           order of items having the same value might change.
%
%INPUTS: A  An array, 2D matrix, or linear cell array that is to be sorted.
%           When given a matrix, the comparison function gtCompareFunc must
%           be provided so that it is clear how the columns are compared
%           (or the rows if byCol is false).
%     byCol A boolean value indicating whether sorting should be performed
%           by row or by column. This must be specified when a matrix is
%           passed as as a linear array could be confused with a matrix
%           with just one row/column. The default if this parameter is
%           omitted and the input is 1-dimensional is whatever would sort
%           over the 1D array. If the input is 2D, then the default is
%           true. This parameter is not used when cell arrays are passed
%           (an empty matrix can be passed for this) as only linear cell
%           arrays are supported, so no ambiguity between 1D and 2D inputs
%           would exist.
% gtCompareFunc  A function handle that performs a greather-than comparison
%           of two entries in A. This lets one define custom comparison
%           operations. Providing a less-than comparison for this will
%           cause the list to be sorted in descending order rather than
%           ascending order. When sorting an array or matrix, the the
%           function handle takes inputs of the form
%           gtCompareFunc(A(:,i),A(:,j)) if byCol=true and with reversed
%           row and column indices if byCol=false. When comparing cell
%           arrays, it must handle inputs of the form
%           gtCompareFunc(A{i},A{j}). The default if this parameter is
%           omitted is @(x1,x2)(x1>x2);
%
%OUTPUTS: A The sorted array/ matrix/ cell array. If gtCompareFunc
%           performs a greater-than comparison, then it is in increasing
%           order. Otherwise it is in decreasing order.
%   idxList The indices of the original elements with respect to the sorted
%           order. For example, if the input A is an array, then
%           A(idxList) on the input A will give the sorted output A.
%
%The quicksort algorithm is based on the description given in Chapter 7 of
%[1]. However, it has been modified to eliminate the recursion.
%
%Note that sorting large matrices can be slow as each element (so an entire
%row/ column) is copied during the search. Thus, if one is just sorting
%according to a particular row, it makes sense ot get the idxList for that
%one row and then use it to sort everything else.

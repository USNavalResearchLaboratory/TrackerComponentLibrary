function [z,ze]=doubleLengthSum(x,xe,y,ye)
%%DOUBLELENGTHSUM Given two doublelength values, which could, for example,
%       be returned by exactPairMult or exactPairSum, find their sum as
%       another doublelength value.
%
%INPUTS: x,xe A real doublelength floating point number. The exact number
%             is x+xe (added with infinite precision) and
%             abs(xe)<=abs(x+xe)*2^(-t)/(1+2^(-t)), where t is the number
%             of bits in the mantissa, which is 53, since it is assumed
%             that these values are floating point doubles.
%       y, ye A second real doublelength floating point number that should
%             be added to x,xe.
%
%OUTPUTS: z, ze The doublelength floating point number that is the sum of
%               (x,xe) and (y,ye). If the inputs satisfy the proper
%               splitting of the number into two parts, (the relation in
%               size between abs(xe) and abs(x+xe) and similarly for y and
%               ye), then this will also satisfy the splitting of the
%               numbers. This does not necessarily hold if denormalized
%               numbers are encountered.
%
%This function implements the Add2 algorithm of [1].
%
%Note that this assumes that the processor rounding mode has been set to
%round to "nearest," which is the default in Matlab, but which can be
%changed using the function setProcRoundingMode.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% [z,ze]=doubleLengthSum(1,1e-30,1e20,1e-1)
%One gets z=1e20 and ze=1.1. The 1e-30 component is truncated away, because
%it is too small to represent with two doubles.

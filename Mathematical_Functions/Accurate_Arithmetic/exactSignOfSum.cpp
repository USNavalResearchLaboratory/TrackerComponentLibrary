/**EXACTSIGNOFSUM Compute the exact sign of the sum of a number of finite
 *                numbers. The sign computation occurs exactly, regardless
 *                of whether the actual sum value would have overflowed or
 *                suffered an accumulation of finite precision errors
 *                whereby just adding them would have given the wrong
 *                result.
 *
 *INPUTS: S An NX1 or 1XN vector whereby one desires the sign of the sum of
 *          the elements.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: sgn This is 1 if the exact sum of the elements of S is
 *             positive, 0 if it is zero and -1 if it is negative.
 *
 *The algorithm is taken from [1], where code is provided in an appendix.
 *The code with minor changes and corrections is also available from Jon
 *Rokne's web site at
 *http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~rokne/
 *The implementation here uses the corrections and uses the sort algorithm
 *in C++ standard template library rather than the sort algorithm provided
 *by Rokne.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *sgn=exactSignOfSum(S);

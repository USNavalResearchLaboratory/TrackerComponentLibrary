function s=accurateSum(a,algorithm,sortVals)
%%ACCURATESUM Sum the elements in a vector in a manner that reduces finite
%             precision errors when summing large and small values as
%             compared to sequentially summing the terms.
%
%INPUTS: a An nX1 or 1Xn vector of real values.
% algorithm An optional parameter that specifies the algorithm to use for
%          the summation. Possible values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use the 
%            improved Kahan-Babuska procedure as described in [1].
%          1 Use the Kahan-Babuska procedure, which is in [1] and shown to
%            be inferior to the improved procedure.
%   doSort This parameter indicates whether the values in a should be
%          sorted in ascending order by magnitude prior to summing. This
%          also improves the accuracy when given values of highly differing
%          magnitudes. The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed
%          is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: s The sum of the values in a.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%Consider the following summation, whose correct value is 3.
% a=[1,1e100,2,-1e100];
% sMatlab=sum(a)
% s=accurateSum(a)
%As of Matlab 2018b, one will get sMatlab=0 (incorrect) and s=3 (correct).
%Note that Matlab's sum function still has the same result even if one
%sorts the values.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here, we demonstrate how sorting can improve the accuracy of the results.
% a=[1e100;2;1;eps();eps();eps();-1e100];
% sUnsorted=accurateSum(a,[],false)
% sSorted=accurateSum(a,[],true)
% sMatlab=sum(a)
%One will get sUnsorted=3, sSorted=3.000000000000001, which is more
%correct, and sMatlab=0 (as of Matlab 2018b), which is just wrong.

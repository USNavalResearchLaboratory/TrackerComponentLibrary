function lattice = FibonacciSphereLattice(N)
%%FIBONACCISPHERELATTICE Generates 3D vectors corresponding to the
%                        spherical Fibonacci lattice.
%
%INPUT:
% N: An integer which determines how many points to generate in the
%    lattice.
%
%OUTPUT:
% lattice: A 3-by-N matrix containing column vectors corresponding to each
%          point in the lattice.
%
%EXAMPLE: Generates a lattice of 100 points and plots the points and convex
%         hull.
% lat = FibonacciSphereLattice(100);
% figure(1); clf
% plot3(lat(1,:),lat(2,:),lat(3,:),'o')
% grid on
% figure(2); clf
% trisurf(convhull(lat(1,:),lat(2,:),lat(3,:)),lat(1,:),lat(2,:),lat(3,:))

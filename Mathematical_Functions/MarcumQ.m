function Q=MarcumQ(mu,alpha,beta,returnOneMinus)
%%MARCUMQ  Evaluate the generalized Marcum Q function of a desired order,
%          Q_M(alpha,beta) including when the order is not an integer.
%
%INPUTS: mu The scalar order (mu>0) of the Marcum Q function. The function
%           is most stable if mu is an integer or if alpha is zero if mu is
%           not an integer.
%     alpha The scalar first parameter of the Q function (alpha>=0).
%      beta The scalar second parameter of the Q function (beta>=0).
% returnOneMinus If this is true 1 minus the value  of the Marcum Q
%           function is returned instead of the Marcum Q function itself.
%           The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: Q The value of the generalized Marcum Q function with the given
%           parameters.
%
%DEPENDENCIES: GammaD.m
%
%Note that the parameter order is different from that used in the marcumq
%function that is part of Matlab's statistics toolbox. Also note that
%Matlab's function cannot handle non-integer orders at all.
%
%This function tries to combine the best implementations of the MarcumQ
%function for a wide range of parameters. The most reliable results are
%obtained if mu is an integer or alpha is zero. The algorithms used are
%specifically,
%- When alpha=0, the MarcumQ function becomes a regularized gamma function.
%  Thus, the build-in gammainc function can be used for a very wide range
%  of (non-integer) values of mu and beta.
%- When alpha is not zero, but mu is a multiple of 0.5, then
%  the algorithm of [1] is used.
%- If alpha is not zero and mu is not a multiple of 0.5, then the
%  equivalency of the Marcum Q function with the noncentral chi square CDF
%  and therefore the noncentral gamma CDF is used to compute the result.
%
%Note that a result from the [2] was used to modify the implementation of
%Benton's algorithm in [1] for large input values.
%
%Also, for those looking to understand the difficulty of computing the
%MarcumQ function, the following algorithms are implemented as
%separate functions in this file but are not used, because they are
%inferior to the algorithms chosen. The algorithms are not
%used either because they are not as stable or they are slower. The
%algorithms are taken from [3], [4], [5], [6], and [7].

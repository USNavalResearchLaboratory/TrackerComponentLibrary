function vals=prevPow2Val(n)
%%PREVPOW2VAL Given a value n, return the value that is the closest power
%             of 2 that is <=abs(n).
%
%INPUTS: n A matrix or scalar. This can be any numeric type.
%
%OUTPUTS: vals A real matrix or scalar of the same type as n where each
%              element is the closest power of 2 that is <=abs(n).
%
%EXAMPLE:
% n=0.5:1:16.5;
% vals=prevPow2Val(n)
%One will get vals=[0,1,2,2,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,16] .

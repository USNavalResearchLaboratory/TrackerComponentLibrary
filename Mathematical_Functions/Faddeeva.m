function wz=Faddeeva(z)
%%FADDEEVA Compute the Faddeeva function (also known as the Kramp function)
%          of the possibly complex argument z. This is a scaled
%          complementary error function. It equals exp(-z^2)*erfc(-1j*z)
%          However, Matlab's built-in erf function cannot handle complex
%          numbers. This function implements the algorithm described in
%          [1].
%
%INPUTS: z A scalar, vector or matrix of values at which one wishes to
%          evaluate the Faddeeva function.
%
%OUTPUTS: wz A matrix having the same dimensions as z in which the values
%            of the Faddeeva function are computed for the values in z.
%
%The Faddeeva arises in a number of physics problems involving waves. It is
%also related to the complex error function, Fresnel integrals. The
%algorithm of [1], which is a modification of [2], is used except. Because
%[1] is used, the modification of [2] that is described in [3] to improve
%the accuracy when near the real axis does not appear to be necessary and
%is not used here.

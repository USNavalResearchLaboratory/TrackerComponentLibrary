function S=hypergeometric0F1(a,z)
%%HYPERGEOMETRIC0F1 Evaluate the confluent hypergeometric function 0F1 for
%                   real or complex parameters. This is the confluent
%                   hypergeometric limit function 0F1(;a;z).
%
%INPUTS: a A real or complex scalar value.
%        z A real or complex scalar value.
%
%OUTPUTS: S The value 0F1(;a;z).
%
%This implements the Taylor series expansion of APpendix I of [1]. It was
%noted that the series generated at least 12 digits of accuracy for
%abs(z)<=1000. A check was added for values of a that are real and negtive
%as the solution should be infinite in that case. However, neighboring
%solutions are finite.

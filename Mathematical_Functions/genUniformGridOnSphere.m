function z=genUniformGridOnSphere(numPts)
%%GENUNIFORMGRIDONSPHERE Generate a uniform grid of Cartesian points on the
%                        surface of a unit sphere. 
%
%INPUTS: numPts This is the desired number of points to obtain on the
%               sphere. The actual number of points obtained can be
%               different.
%
%OUTPUTS: z A 3XnumGenPoints set of 3D Cartesian points approximately
%           uniformly distributed on the 3D unit sphere.
%
%This function implements the deterministic algorithm of [1]. 
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This example generates 500 points on the unit sphere and then display
%them, so that one can see that the points are approximately uniform on the
%sphere.
% pts=genUniformGridOnSphere(500);
% scatter3(pts(1,:),pts(2,:),pts(3,:))

%%VANDERCORPUTSEQ Obtain values of the van der Corput sequence. This is a
%           low-discrepance 1D sequency with values ranging from 0 to 1.
%           Such sequence values can be used for 1D quasi-Monte Carlo
%           integration, which can have better performance than Monte Carlo
%           integration. For multivariate quasi-Monte Carlo integration
%           problems, other sequences, such as the Halton sequence, should
%           be used as this will perform poorly.
%
%INPUTS: N A vector indicating the size of the point set to generate. N(i)
%          is the size of dimension i of points. For example, for a 10X1
%          vector, one should set N=[10;1]. If a scalar is passed, then a
%          matrix of size [N,N] is generated.
% skipFirst The number of values at the start of the van der Corput
%          sequence to skip before recording values in points. The default
%          if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is 0.
% stepSize Rather than taking every point in the sequence, every stepSize
%          point is taken. The default if omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed is 1, meaning that every point is taken.
%     base Different sequences are defined for different bases (integer
%          values >=2). This is the base to use. If this parameter and
%          sigma are both omitted, then base=36 and the good permutation
%          sigma for base 36 that is given in Theorem 1.2 of [1] is used.
%          If base is omitted but sigma is given, then the value implied by
%          sigma is used.
%    sigma Improved performance can be obtained by permuting the order of
%          the digits creating the terms of the sequence, as given in the
%          equation below. This is a baseX1 or 1Xbase permutation of the
%          digits 0:(base-1) that starts with 0. If this parameter is
%          omitted and base is provided, then the good permutation that is
%          given in Section 3.1 of [1] is used. If base is omitted, then
%          base and sigma are both set as described for the base input.
%
%OUTPUTS: points The set of values of the van der Corput sequence for the
%                given parameters. These are values between 0 and 1.
%
%The value of the ith entry in a van der Corput sequence S(n) is
%S(n)=sum_{j=0}^Inf sigma(a(j))*base^{-j-1}
%where the vector a is the digits of the number n converted into the
%specified base and sigma is a permutation of the values of 0:(base-1) that
%begins with 0.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%A plot of a histogram of the points indicates that they can be relatively
%well distributed between 0 and 1 even though they are not pseudo-random.
% vals=vanDerCorputSeq([1000,1]);
% figure(1)
% clf
% histogram(vals,'normalization','probability')
% h1=xlabel('Value');
% h2=ylabel('Fraction of Samples');
% set(gca,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')
% set(h1,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')
% set(h2,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')

%%MAKEFAUREPERM This generates the permutation suggested by Faure for
%               improving the van der Corput sequence, given in Section 3.1 
%               of [1]. The expressions in [1] can be a bit difficult to
%               understand. the formulation given in Section 4.3 of [2] is
%               clearer.

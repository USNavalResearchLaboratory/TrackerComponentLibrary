function [xi,w]=firstOrderPrismCubPoints()
%%FIRSTORDERPRISMCUBPOINTS Generate first-order cubature points for
%  integration over a standard prism in 3D. This is a triangle that has
%  been extruded upward. The vertices are (1,-1,-1), (-1,-1,-1), (-1,1,-1),
%  (1,-1,1), (-1,-1,1), and (-1,1,1).
% 
%INPUTS: None
%
%OUTPUTS: xi This is a 3XnumCubPoints set of points for the standard prism.
%          w A 1XnumCubPoints set of cubature weights. This sums to the
%            volume of the standard prism (4).
%
%This function implements the points given in [1] (1 point). This just
%returns the point [-1/3;-1/3;0] with weight 4.

%%CALCCUBPOINTMOMENTS Using cubature integration with specified cubature
%                     points and weights, determine the first two moments
%                     of a transformation of a value x that is corrupted
%                     with additive Gaussian. x is a Gaussian distributed
%                     random variable with mean z and covariance matrix
%                     S*S'. The mean vector mu and covariance matrice P
%                     returned are those of h(x), where h is a function
%                     provided. Cubature integration using the provided
%                     cubature points and weights.
%
%INPUTS: z The numDimX1 value added to the zero-mean Gaussian noise with
%          covariance R that is driving the system.
%        S The numDimXnumDim lower-triangular square root covariance matrix
%          of the zero-mean Gaussian noise driving the system. If R is the
%          covariance matrix of the noise, then S=cholSemiDef(R,'lower');
%        h A function handle for how the vector z is transformed. This
%          function must be able to take a numDimXnumPoints matrix of
%          transformed z values and return a numDimOutXnumPoints matrix of
%          the transformed vectors. The return values of the
%          calcCubPointMoments function are the mean and covariance matrix
%          of h(x), where x is Gaussian noise with covariance matrix S*S'
%          and mean z.
%       xi An optional numDimXnumPoints matrix of cubature points for
%          normal 0-I distribution. If this and w are omitted, then a
%          default (probably inefficient) set of cubature points and
%          weights is generated using fifthOrderCubPoints.
%        w A numPointsX1 vector of the weights associated with each of
%          the cubature points in xi. Note that all w>=0 and normally
%          sum(w)=1. If this and xi are omitted, then a default (probably
%          inefficient) set of cubature points and weights is generated
%          using fifthOrderCubPoints.
% diffTransFun An optional function handle that transforms differences
%           between values when computing the covariance. Though
%           calcCubPointMoments is not meant for use with circular data,
%           passing a function to wrap data can be used as an ad-hoc fix
%           for computing a covariance matrix when using circular data,
%           such as when dealing with longitudinal values. THis should be
%           omitted if not needed.
%
%OUTPUTS: mu The mean of h(x) found using cubature integration.
%          P The covariance matrix of h(x) found using cubature
%            integration.
%
%This function is only appropriate when the domain of the transformed
%points is linear. For example, if the transformation results in an
%angle from -pi to pi, then angles near +/-pi might get averaged to zero,
%producing very bad results. In such an instance, the relevant components
%of the mixture should be averaged using meanAng or one should pass a
%function for diffTransFun.

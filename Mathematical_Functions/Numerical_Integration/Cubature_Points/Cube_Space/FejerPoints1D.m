function [xi,w]=FejerPoints1D(n,rule)
%%FEJERPOINTS1D Compute one of two types of Fejer quadrature points and
%          weights for integrating polynomials (or approximating integrals
%          of non-polynomials) over the range -1 to 1. Fejer's first rule
%          produces points n points allowing for an order n-1 quadrature
%          rule and Fejer's second rules produces n-1 points allowing for
%          an order n-2 quadrature rule. Contrast with with
%          GaussLegendrePoints1D, where  n+1 points can integration all
%          polynomials up to order 2*n+1 using n points. However, the Fejer
%          points perform well with non-polynomial functions, so they are
%          not necessarily worse than Gauss-Legendre points.
%
%INPUTS: n The parameter related to the number of points produced. For
%          rule=1, n points are produced and for rule=2, n-1 points are
%          produced.
%     rule A parameter specifying the Fejer interpolation rule to use.
%          The rules are described in [1]. Possible values are:
%          1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use
%             Fejer's first rule.
%          2 Use Fejer's second rule.
%
%%OUTPUTS: xi A 1XnumPoints vector containing the quadrature points.
%          w A numPointsX1 vector of the weights associated with the
%            quadrature points. Note that these sum to 2, not 1, and are
%            all positive.
%
%The algorithms of [1] are implemented.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we integrate x.^2.*exp(-x.^2-x/2) from -1 to 1 using the Fejer
%quadrature points. We then compare the result to an analytic solution.
% [xi,w]=FejerPoints1D(30);
% f=@(x)(x.^2.*exp(-x.^2-x/2));
% numIntSol=sum(w'.*f(xi));
% analyticSol=(-12-20*exp(1)+9*exp(25/16)*sqrt(pi)*(erf(3/4)+erf(5/4)))/(32*exp(3/2));
% 
% relError=(numIntSol-analyticSol)/abs(analyticSol)
%One can see that the relative error is om the order of eps(1), so the
%analytic and quadrature solutions agree well.

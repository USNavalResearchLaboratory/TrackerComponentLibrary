function [xi,w]=FejerPtsWeighted1D(moments,rule)
%%FEJERPTSWEIGHTED1D Compute one of two types of Fejer quadrature points
%          and weights for integrating polynomials (or approximating
%          integrals of non-polynomials) over the range -1 to 1 times a
%          weighting function w(x) whose moments are given with respect to
%          Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind from order 0 to n are
%          given by the input moments. This function is more general than
%          FejerPoints1D, but requires the user to provide the moments.
%
%INPUTS: moments A length n+1 vector containing values of the integral
%                int_{-1}^1 T_k(x) w(xx) dx for k=0 to n, where w(x) is the
%                weighting function over which integration using these
%                quadrature points should be performed.
%           rule A parameter specifying the Fejer interpolation rule to use.
%                The rules are described in [1]. Possible values are:
%                1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed)
%                  Use Fejer's first rule.
%                2 Use Fejer's second rule.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi A 1XnumPoints vector containing the quadrature points.
%          w A numPointsX1 vector of the weights associated with the
%            quadrature points.
%
%This function implements the algorithm described in [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we generate a formula for integration over Gegenbauer polynomials,
%using GegenbauerPolyChebMoments to get the necessary moments of the
%polynomials with respect to Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind.
% k=16;
% lambda=pi;
% %Note that odd moments are all zero.
% moments((0:2:(2*k))+1)=GegenbauerPolyChebMoments(lambda,k);
% [xi,w]=FejerPtsWeighted1D(moments);
% 
% %We compare the integral of x^24 times the Gegenbauer polynomial using the
% %cubature points to an analytic solution.
% numIntVal=sum(xi.^(24).*w.');
% exactVal=(316234143225*sqrt(pi)*gamma(1/2+pi))/(4096*gamma(13+pi));
% relErr=(numIntVal-exactVal)/abs(exactVal)
%One will see that the relative error is near eps(1) indicating that there
%is a very good integral approximation.

%%SECONDORDERCUBPOINTSBINGHAM Generate second-order cubature points for
%                   numeric integrals involving the Bingham distribution,
%                   which is defined on a unit (hyper-)sphere. The Bingham
%                   distribution is a central version of the Fisher-Bingham
%                   distribution. The PDF is
%                   f(x|A,g)=(1/c)*exp(-x'*A*x+g'*x)
%                   with g=0 and c a normalizing constant.
%
%INPUTS: A A numDimXnumDim type of inverse covariance matrix for the
%          distribution. It must be symmetric. It does not have to be
%          positive definite.
%   lambda An optional parameter that affects how much weights is assigned
%          to a point placed at the pole. This must be between 0 and 1.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi A numDim X numCubaturePoints matrix containing the cubature
%            points. (Each "point" is a vector)
%          w A numCubaturePoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with
%            the cubature points.

%The algorithm implementes is essentially that given in Section III of [1],

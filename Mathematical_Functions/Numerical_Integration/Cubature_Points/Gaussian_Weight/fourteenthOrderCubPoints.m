function [xi,w]=fourteenthOrderCubPoints(numDim,beta,randomize)
%%FOURTEENTHORDERCUBPOINTS Generate fourteenth order cubature points for
%           integration  over a multivariate Gaussian PDF times |x|^beta
%           (beta=0 means just the Gaussian PDF). The weighting function is
%           thus w(x)=1/(2*pi)^(numDim/2)*norm(x)^beta*exp(-x'*x/2).
%
%INPUTS: numDim An integer specifying the dimensionality of the points to
%               be generated. Currently, only 3D points are supported.
%          beta An integer specifying the exponent of the norm(x) term in
%               the weighting function (the thing times the normal PDF in
%               the weighting function). beta>-numDim. If omitted or an
%               empty matrix is passed, beta=0 is used.
%     randomize If this parameter is true, then the points will be
%               multiplied by a random orthonormal rotation matrix. This
%               does not change the moments up to the order of the points.
%               This randomization is done in [1] and [2] to lessen various
%               effects that arise when using points in the same
%               orientation repeatedly in tracking. The default if this
%               parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi A numDim X numCubaturePoints matrix containing the cubature
%            points (Each "point" is a vector).
%          w A numCubaturePoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with
%            the cubature points.
%
%This function gets fourteenth-order spherical surface points using
%fourteenthOrderSpherSurfCubPoints
%and then transforms them to work with a multidimensional Gaussian PDF
%using
%spherSurfPoints2GaussPoints.

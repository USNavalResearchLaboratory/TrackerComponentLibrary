function [xi, w]=thirdOrderCubPoints(numDim,algorithm,w0,randomize)
%THIRDORDERCUBPOINTS Generate third order cubature points for integration
%           involving a multidimensional Gaussian probability density
%           function (PDF).
%
%INPUTS: numDim An integer specifying the dimensionality of the points to
%               be generated; numDim>=1.
%     algorithm An optional parameter specifying the algorithm to be used
%               to generate the points. Possible values are
%               0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed and
%                 numDim~=1) Use the algorithm of [1] (The "cubature
%                 Kalman filter") set of points. This is the same as the
%                 third-order set that is derived in [4].
%               1 Use the "basic points" for the unscented Kalman filter
%                 given in Section IIIA of [2].
%               2 Use the "extended symmetric set" from Section IVA of [2].
%               3 Formula E_n^{r^2} 3-1 on page 315 of [3],2*numDim points.
%               4 Formula E_n^{r^2} 3-2 on page 316 of [3],2^numDim points.
%               5 (The default if numDim==1) Call quadraturePoints1D(2), 2
%                 points, numDim=1.
%            w0 An optional input parameter that is only used in algorithm
%               2. This is the value of w(1), the coefficient associated
%               with a cubature point placed at the origin. It is required
%               that w(0)>0. Making w0 larger than 1 will lead to having
%               mostly negative weights. If omitted or an empty matrix is
%               passed, a default value of 1/3 is used.
%     randomize If this parameter is true, then the points will be
%               multiplied by a random orthonormal rotation matrix. This
%               does not change the moments up to the order of the points.
%               This randomization is done in [5] and [6] to lessen various
%               effects that arise when using points in the same
%               orientation repeatedly in tracking. The default if this
%               parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%               This parameter is ignored if numDim==1.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi A numDim X numCubaturePoints matrix containing the cubature
%            points (Each "point" is a vector).
%          w A numCubaturePoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with
%            the cubature points.
%
%Algorithms 1-2 are not normally identified as being "third-order".
%However, due to their symmetry of the points, their odd moments are all
%zero.
%
%For more details on how to use these points, see the comments in the
%function fifthOrderCubPoints.m.

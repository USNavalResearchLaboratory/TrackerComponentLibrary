function [xi,w]=GenzKeisterPoints(numDim,m,algorithm,epsVal,randomize)
%%GENZKEISTERPOINTS Generate multiple dimensional cubature points and
%             weights for integration involving a multidimensional Gaussian
%             probability density function (PDF) using the method of Genz
%             and Keister in [1].
%
%INPUTS: numDim A positive integer specifying the dimensionality of the
%               points to be generated.
%             m An integer related to the number of generator points used.
%               This must be >0 and <=17 for algorithm 0 and <=15 for
%               algorithm 1 unless algorithm provides a different set of
%               parameters from which higher order generators can be found.
%     algorithm An optional parameter indicating how the cubature points
%               are generated. Possible values are
%               0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed)
%                 Use the Q(25)[1+2+6+10+16] generator that is given in
%                 the first column of Table 3.4 in [1].
%               1 Use the Q(25)[1+2+8+20] generator that is given in the
%                 second column of Table 3.4 in [1].
%              nu This is a vector of increment values nu as in [1] so that
%                 a new generator can be computed. The generator using
%                 these values is computed based off the first two
%                 generator points being fixed at 0 and sqrt(3). More
%                 details on this input are given in the comments below.
%       epsVal An optional parameter specifying how small the absolute
%              value of a weight must be before the weight and associated
%              cubature point are omitted. The generators given in the
%              paper were designed so that many weights are numerically
%              zero, meaning that cubature formula need far fewer points.
%              If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%              the default value of eps(1) is used.
%    randomize If this parameter is true, then the points will be
%              multiplied by a random orthonormal rotation matrix. This
%              does not change the moments up to the order of the points.
%              This randomization is done in [3] and [4] to lessen various
%              effects that arise when using points in the same
%              orientation repeatedly in tracking. The default if this
%              parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%              
%OUTPUTS: xi A d X numCubaturePoints matrix containing the cubature points.
%            (Each "point" is a vector)
%          w A numCubaturePoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with
%            the cubature points.
%
%The algorithm of [1], which is an extension of that of [2] is used. For
%more details on how to use these points when integrating over a Gaussian
%PDF, see the comments in the function fifthOrderCubPoints.m.
%
%The algorithm is based on initially determining a set of generating
%coefficients lambda, where the first two are fixed at 1 and sqrt(3).
%The coefficients are determined by recursively expanding the number of
%coefficients in intervals. The generator Q_P obtained the coefficients by
%expanding them in intervals of nu=[3;5;8]. The generator \hat{Q}_P
%expanded them in intervals of nu=[4;10]; The total number of points for an
%interval vector nu is 2+sum(nu) Though the option is given to generate
%other coefficients, which would be done using the 
%getGenzKeisterGenerators subroutine in this function, this is generally a
%bad idea. First, not all intervals produce valid coefficients, so an error
%can occur when a bad combination is attempted. More importantly, however,
%is the fact that extended precision is usually needed to compute the
%generators to a reasonable accuracy. The tabulated values used for
%algorithm=0 and algorithm=1 were computed using extended precision by the
%authors of [1] and are taken from the paper. Though the subroutine
%getGenzKeisterGenerators can recreate the results, there is a severe loss
%of precision with the higher-order lamba terms.

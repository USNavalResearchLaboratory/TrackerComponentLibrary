function [xi,w]=secondOrderCubPoints(numDim,w0,alpha,randomize)
%SECONDDORDERCUBPOINTS Generate second order cubature points for 
%           integration involving a multidimensional Gaussian probability
%           density function (PDF). The algorithm implemented is the scaled
%           unscented transformation of [2], which is just a minor
%           generalization of the spherical sigma points given in Appendix
%           III of [1]. If alpha=1, then one has the spherical sigma
%           points.
%
%INPUTS: numDim An integer specifying the dimensionality of the points to
%               be generated.
%            w0 An optional input parameter. This is the value of w(1), the
%               coefficient associated with a cubature point placed at the
%               origin. It is required that 1>w0>0. If omitted or an empty
%               matrix is passed, a default value of 1/3 is used.
%         alpha An optional input parameter. This is a positive scale
%               factor, which affects how far the cubature points that are
%               not placed at the origin spread out from the origin. If
%               this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%               then the default of 1 is used.
%    randomize If this parameter is true, then the points will be
%              multiplied by a random orthonormal rotation matrix. This
%              does not change the moments up to the order of the points.
%              This randomization is done in [3] and [4] to lessen various
%              effects that arise when using points in the same
%              orientation repeatedly in tracking. The default if this
%              parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi A numDim X numCubaturePoints matrix containing the cubature
%            points. (Each "point" is a vector)
%          w A numCubaturePoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with
%            the cubature points.
%
%The algorithm implemented is for the scaled unscented transform of [2],
%which is just a modified form of the  spherical simplex sigma points from
%Appendix III of [1]. The algorithm of [1] is modified because all of the
%cubature points, as described in the paper, need to be multiplied by
%(1/sqrt((1/w0-1)/(numDim+1))) to assure that the sample covariance matrix
%of the points has a unit diagonal. In [2], the formula for the scaled
%weights in Equation 24 is incorrect. The correct form is given in Equation
%15 of [2].

%%SPHERSURFPOINTS2GAUSSPOINTS Given cubature points of a certain order for
%               integration over the surface of a unit (hyper-)sphere,
%               obtain cubature points for integration over a multivariate
%               Gaussian PDF times |x|^beta (beta=0 means just the Gaussian
%               PDF). The weighting function is thus
%               w(x)=1/(2*pi)^(numDim/2)*norm(x)^beta*exp(-x'*x/2).
%
%INPUTS: xiSurf, wSurf A numDimXnumPoints set of cubture points and the
%               corresponding numPointsX1 set of cubature weights for
%               integration over the surface of the unit sphere.
%         order The positive order of the spherical surface cubature points
%               passed. This will also be the order of spherical points
%               produced by the algorithm.
%          beta An integer specifying the exponent of the norm(x) term in
%               the weighting function (the thing times the normal PDF in
%               the weighting function). beta>-numDim. If omitted or an
%               empty matrix is passed, beta=0 is used.
%     randomize If this parameter is true, then the points will be
%               multiplied by a random orthonormal rotation matrix. This
%               does not change the moments up to the order of the points.
%               This randomization is done in [2] and [3] to lessen various
%               effects that arise when using points in the same
%               orientation repeatedly in tracking. The default if this
%               parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi A numDim X numCubaturePoints matrix containing the cubature
%            points. (Each "point" is a vector)
%          w A numCubaturePoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with
%            the cubature points.
%
%The method of taking a spherical shell and a formula for a 1D integral
%over exp(-x^2) times |x|^beta and transforming it for multiple dimensions
%is described in Chapter 2.8 of [1]. The transformation to a Gaussian PDF
%is performed by scaling the points and weights.
%
%As an example, consider obtaining fourteenth-order points for integrating
%over a Gaussian PDF in 3D:
% [xiSurf,wSurf]=fourteenthOrderSpherSurfCubPoints(3);
% [xi,w]=spherSurfPoints2GaussPoints(xiSurf,wSurf,14);
% %As a test for the points, consider the integral of z^14:
% sum(bsxfun(@times,sum(xi(1,:).^14,1),w'))
%One will find that the result is the same as the 14th moment in the first
%dimension given by GaussianD.momentGenFun(zeros(3,1),eye(3),[14;0;0])

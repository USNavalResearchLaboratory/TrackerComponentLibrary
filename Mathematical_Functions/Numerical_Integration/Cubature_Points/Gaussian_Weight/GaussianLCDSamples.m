function [xi,w,CvMDistMin,exitCode,sInit]=GaussianLCDSamples(numDim,numSamples,forceCovMatch,LBFGSOptions,numIntOptions,bMax,sInit)
%%GAUSSIANLCDSAMPLES Generate cubature points for a multidimensional N(0,I)
%              Gaussian distribution using an optimization over a
%              Modified Cramer-von Mises (CvM) distance between localized
%              cumulative distributions (LCDs). As opposed to having a
%              fixed polynomial order, the cubature points are generated as
%              a best fit (based on the CvM distance) for a fixed number of
%              points. Thus, when used for cubature integration, the points
%              might not be exact for any order, but should be good over a
%              wide range of orders. The approach, as applied to track
%              filtering, is described in [2]. The symmetric algorithm of
%              [1] is used here. If an initial point pattern (sInit) is not
%              given, then running this function multiple times with the
%              same inputs will give different results.
%
%INPUTS: numDim An integer specifying the dimensionality of the cubature
%               points to be generated.
%    numSamples The number of points to use to approximate a normal zero
%               mean Gaussian distribution with the identity matrix as its
%               covariance. This must be >=2*numDim for the covariance
%               matrix of the resulting samples to be non-singular.
% forceCovMatch An optional argument specifying that the covariance matrix
%               should be forced to match that of a normal (0,I)
%               distribution. The basic algorithm best fits the
%               distribution according to certain measures that usually
%               underestimate the diagonal elements of the covariance
%               matrix. The default if this is omitted is true, unless
%               numSamples<2*numDim, in which case it is false, because
%               such a match cannot be achieved with symmetric samples.
%  LBFGSOptions A structure containing parameters for the limited-memory
%               Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm, which is used
%               as a subroutine for optimization. Each member of the
%               structure is named after an option in the input to the
%               quasiNewtonLBFGS function. Possible members are numCorr,
%               epsilon, deltaTestDist, delta, lineSearchParams,
%               maxIterations, progressCallback. Note that the C and
%               l1NormRange members within lineSearchParams are not used.
%               The meanings of the parameters iaredescribed in the
%               comments to the quasiNewtonLBFGS function. If this
%               structure is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
%               the default values will be used. If any of the members of
%               the structure are omitted or empty matrices are passed,
%               then the default values will be used.
% numIntOptions A structure whose parameters specify the accuracy of the
%               scalar numerical integration used in this function. The
%               possible members are:
%               AbsTol The absolute error tolerance. Between a value x and
%                      its estimate xHat, this is abs(x-xHat).
%               RelTol The relative error tolerance. Between a value x and
%                      its estimate xHat, this is
%                      abs(x-xHat)/min(abs(x),abs(xHat))
%               The default values are both 1e-14. If this parameter is
%               omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the default values
%               are used. If either member of the structure is omitted or
%               is assigned an empty matrix, the default value is used.
%          bMax The upper bound of the integrals, defined as in [1].
%               Higher numbers lead to more precise results; numbers too
%               high will run into finite precision problems with respect
%               to the integral. For numDim<=1000, the authors in [1],
%               suggest using 70. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%               the default value of 70 is used.
%         sInit An optional numDim X fix(numSamples/2) set of points that
%               is used as the seed for the algorithm. If omitted, a
%               random seed is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi The numDim X numSamples set of cubature points for the normal
%            0-I distribution. If the exit code is not positive, then an
%            empty matrix is returned.
%          w The numDimX1 set of weights associated with the cubature
%            points. These are all just 1/numSamples. If the exit code is
%            not positive, then an empty matrix is returned.
% CvMDistMin The minimum Cramer-von Mises distance between the LCD of the
%            points and a standard multivariate gaussian distribution.
%   exitCode A number indicating the termination state of the algorithm.
%            A zero or positive number indicates success. Possible values
%            are the same as those of the quasiNewtonLBFGS function (see
%            comments to that function), with one addition:
%            -2 The points found  formed a singular covariance matrix and
%            forceCovMatch=true. If the sample covariance matrix is
%            singular, then it is not possible to force it to match the
%            true covariance matrix when using symmetric samples.
%      sInit The random seed used to seed the algorithm.
%
%Comments in the code relating pages, sections and theorems refer to those
%in [1]. The definition of the exponential integral used in [1] is the
%Cauchy principle value integral. However, in Appendix II of [3], one can
%see that the defition omits the case where the argument is zero, but this
%case arises a lot, due to the double sums. The fix added for this instance
%comes by observing the derivation of De3 in Appendices B and C, where it
%can be seen that is s_i=s_j then there is a 0*Inf term, which should just
%equal zero. Thus, the correction here is to "redefine" the exponential
%integral to return 0 when its argument is zero. that avoids the
%introduction of NaN terms to the problem.
%
%Example:
% sInit =[-0.2962    0.3036   -0.2738   -0.0276    1.9153    0.7165;
%          0.5643   -0.7903    0.2719    0.9239    0.1568    1.3373;
%          1.5826    0.8034    1.4896   -0.3213   -0.3005    2.1257;
%          2.7292   -1.3199    1.4371    0.6611   -0.5000    0.0540];
% [xi,w,CvMDistMin,exitCode,sInit]=GaussianLCDSamples(4,13,true,[],[],[],sInit)
%Using sInit as the random seed for the initialization, one obtains points
%with a minimum Cramer-von Mises distance of CvMDistMin=0.0183. The first
%point is at the origin, because an odd number of points was requested.
%
%The function is generally too slow to use to find approximations of
%Gaussian distributions in most real-time systems. However, one can
%precompute points of the desired dimensionalities and create a library
%that can then be called in lieue of using this function.

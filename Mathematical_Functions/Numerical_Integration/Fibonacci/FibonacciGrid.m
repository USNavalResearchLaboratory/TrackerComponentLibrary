function Xfib = FibonacciGrid(N,D,alg,center)
%%FIBONACCIGRID Generates a Fibonacci grid on the unit volume in D
%               dimensions using N points.
%
%INPUT:
% N: The number of points to sample.
% D: The dimension of the space to be sampled.
% alg: An integer indicating which Fibonacci point set to generate:
%      0) (Default) A grid technique due to Purser and based on the
%         algorithm given in [1].
%      1) The standard Fibonacci points which have been proven to have the
%         lowest discrepancy possible in dimension D=2. Noted in [2] and
%         [3]. The number of points output will be the nearest Fibonacci
%         number greater than N. This algorithm is only defined for D=2.
%      2) A variant based on the algorithm in option 1, but loses
%         periodicity in one dimension for non-Fibonacci number of points
%         N. Also noted in [3]. This algorithm is only defined for D=2.
% center: A Boolean which is true if the set should be centered and false
%         otherwise. The standard point sets for algorithms 1 and 2 have a
%         point at (0,0) for every N. If this parameter is true, then the
%         lattice is shifted by 1/(2*N) in both dimensions to provide a
%         lattice centered within the unit square. This only affects
%         options 1 and 2 of alg. The default is false.
%
%OUTPUT:
% Xfib: A D-by-N matrix containing points of a Fibonacci grid.
%
%EXAMPLE: A scatter plot of the 3D Fibonacci grid.
% points = FibonacciGrid(100,3);
% scatter3(points(1,:),points(2,:),points(3,:),'filled')

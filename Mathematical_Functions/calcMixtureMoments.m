function [mu,P]=calcMixtureMoments(xi,w,PHyp,muHyp,diffTransFun,numMergeDims)
%%CALCMIXTUREMOMENTS Given a set of sample vectors xi and associated
%                    weights w, calculate the first two moments of the
%                    mixture. Those are, the mean mu and the covariance
%                    matrix P. An additional input can allow the function
%                    to be used for computing the covariance matrix of a
%                    Gaussian mixture, when xi is the set of mean vectors,
%                    w is the set of  weights and the third input PHyp is
%                    the set of covariance matrices for the hypotheses.
%                    The input muHyp makes P on the output the mean squared
%                    error matrix for an estimate muHyp rather than a
%                    covariance matrix.
%
%INPUTS: xi A numDimXnumPoints matrix of column vectors.
%         w A numPointsX1 or 1XnumPoints vector of the weights associated
%           with each of the column vectors. Normally all w>0 to assure
%           that P is positive definite. It is assumed that the weights sum
%           to 1 when computing the mu and P. If this parameter is omitted
%           or an empty matrix is passed, then all values in w are set to
%           1/numPoints (uniform distribution).
%      PHyp An optional numDimXnumDimXnumPoints parameter. If one wants to
%           find the covariance matrix of a mixture distribution, then this
%           is the set of covariances of the individual components (whose
%           means are xi). If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, P will
%           be computed as the covariance matrix of a bunch of points. If P
%           is not requested on the output, this argument has no effect.
%     muHyp An optional numDimX1 input that changes how the covariance
%           matrix is computed. If something other than an empty matrix is
%           provided, the output P will not be computed centered about mu
%           (it will not be the covariance) but will be computed centered
%           around muHyp, thus making P a mean-squared error matrix. This
%           input can be useful when using calcMixtureMoments to compute
%           updates for the global nearest neighbor joint probabilistic
%           data association filter.
% diffTransFun An optional function handle that transforms differences
%           between values when computing the covariance. Though
%           calcMixtureMoments is not meant for use with circular data,
%           passing a function to wrap data can be used as an ad-hoc fix
%           for computing a covariance matrix when using circular data,
%           such as when dealing with longitudinal values.
% numMergeDims It is possible that numDim> the number of dimensions that
%           one actually cares about for the merged value mu. If so, then
%           this is the number of dimensions that should actually be
%           merged. This discrepancy can arise when reducing models in an
%           IMM for display where some models have additional non-mixing
%           components. The default if this parameter is omitted or an
%           empty matrix is passed is numDim.
%
%OUTPUTS: mu The numMergeDimsX1 mean of the mixture.
%          P The numMergeDimsXnumMergeDims covariance matrix of the
%            mixture.
%
%This function can be used to conveniently compute the mean and covariance
%of a set of cubature points and weights. It can also be used to compute
%the mean and covariance of a Gaussian mixture distribution, if xi are the
%means of the components and w are the weights associated with each
%component in the mixture. This function is also useful in reducing
%mixtures in multiple model algorithms, and reducing hypotheses in data
%association algorithms.
%
%Equations for computing the moments of mixtures are derived in Chapter
%1.4.16 of [1].
%
%The most common uses of this function are of the form
%[mu,P]=calcMixtureMoments(xi,w) for computing the mean and covariance
%matrix of a batch of weighted samples and also of the form 
%[mu,P]=calcMixtureMoments(xi,w,PHyp) for computing the mean and covariance
%matrix of a Gaussian mixture distribution.

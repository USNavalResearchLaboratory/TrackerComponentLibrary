function [z,idxX,idxY]=mergeSortedArraysUniqueWithIdx(x,y)
%%MERGESORTEDARRAYSUNIQUEWITHIDX Given two arrays that are each sorted in
%           ascending order, merge them into one large array that is in
%           ascending order, removing duplicates and keep track of the
%           indices of z into which each element of x and y is placed. When
%           duplicates exist between arrays, favor the y array.
%
%INPUTS: x An xDimX1 or 1XxDim array that has been sorted in ascending
%          order.
%        y A yDimX1 or 1XyDim array that has been sorted in ascending
%          order.
%
%OUTPUTS: z An (xDim+yDim)X1 array containing all of the elements of x and
%           y, in ascending order.
%      idxX An xDimX1 vector such that z(i)=x(idxX(i)).
%      idxY A yDimX1 vector such that z(i)=y(idxY(i)).
%
%The algorithm is taken from Chapter 5.2.4 of [1] and modified to keep
%track of the indices where the merged items land and to remove duplicates.

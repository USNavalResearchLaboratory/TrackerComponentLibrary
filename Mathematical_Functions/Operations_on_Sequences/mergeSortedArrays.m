function z=mergeSortedArrays(x,y)
%MERGESORTEDARRAYS Given two arrays that are each sorted in ascending
%                  order, merge them into one large array that is in
%                  ascending order.
%
%INPUTS: x An xDimX1 or 1XxDim array that has been sorted in ascending
%          order.
%        y A yDimX1 or 1XyDim array that has been sorted in ascending
%          order.
%
%OUTPUTS: z An (xDim+yDim)X1 array containing all of the elements of x and
%           y, in ascending order.
%
%The algorthm is taken from Chapter 5.2.4 of [1]. This is algorithm M
%(two-way merge).

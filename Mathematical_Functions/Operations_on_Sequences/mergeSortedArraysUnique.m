function z=mergeSortedArraysUnique(x,y)
%MERGESORTEDARRAYSUNIQUE Given two arrays that are each sorted in ascending
%           order, merge them into one large array that is in ascending
%           order, removing duplicates.
%
%INPUTS: x An xDimX1 or 1XxDim array that has been sorted in ascending
%          order.
%        y A yDimX1 or 1XyDim array that has been sorted in ascending
%          order.
%
%OUTPUTS: z An NX1 array containing all of the elements of x and y, in
%           ascending order. N<=xDim+yDim.
%
%The algorthm is taken from Chapter 5.2.4 of [1] and modified to remove
%duplicates.

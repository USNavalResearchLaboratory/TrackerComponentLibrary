function angDiff=angBetweenVecs(v1,v2)
%%ANGBETWEENVECS Given vector pairs in 2D or higher space, find the angular
%                distances between them (non-negative values). 
%
%INPUTS: v1 A 3XN matrix of N real vectors or a single 3X1 vector is they
%           are all the same and v2 varies.
%        v2 A 3XN matrix of N real vectors or a single 3X1 vector if all of
%           them are the same and v1 varies.
%
%OUTPUTS: angDiff An 1XN matrix of the angular differences (in radians)
%                 between the vectors in v1 and the corresponding vectors
%                 in v2. The distances can range from 0 to pi.
%
%In 3D, a cross-product formula is used instead of the more logical dot-
%product formula so as to maximize numerical precision when vectors are
%nearly parallel. The vectors do not need to have the same magnitudes.
%Similarly, in 2D, a tangent formula is used. In more than 3D, a cross
%product formula is used.
%
%If one or both of the vectors has zero magnitude, then the angular
%difference will be zero. Note that angBetweenVecs(v1,v2) is the same as
%angBetweenVecs(v2,v1).

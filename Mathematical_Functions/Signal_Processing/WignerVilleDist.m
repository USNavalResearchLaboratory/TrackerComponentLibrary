function [val,t,f]=WignerVilleDist(s,a,freqSamps)
%%WIGNERVILLEDIST Compute the discrete Wigner-Ville distribution. This is a
%    time-frequency distribution. Multiple discretizations of the
%    continuous-time version of the Wigner-Ville distribution exist. This
%    function implements the discrete Wigner-Ville distribution C (DWVD-C),
%    which is described in [1] with a detailed analysis given in [2]. As
%    noted in [1], this specific definition has a number of nice
%    properties. The Wigner-Ville distribution is related to the wideband
%    ambiguity function. An approximate algorithm is also implemented,
%    which allows one to obtain the transform for specific frequencies
%    while decimating the time-scale.
%
%INPUTS: s An NX1 or 1XN signal. s can be real (in which case the complex
%          analytic signal will be found) or s can be complex (representing
%          an analytic signal).
%        a If a is provided, then decimation in time is performed. The time
%          decimation factor a is an integer >=1. It is required that
%          (2*N/a) be an integer. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%          matrix is provided, then a=1 is used.
% freqSamps If only specific frequency values are desired (rather than all
%          frequencies), then this input should be provided and is a set of
%          indices from 1 to N of which frequencies in the full transform
%          are desired. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then
%          freqSamps=1:N is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The ((2*N)/a)XnumFreqSamps discrete Wigner-Ville
%             distribution. The first index is time; the second index is
%             frequency.
%           t The values of the time-samples of the time samples
%             corresponding to the rows of the distribution. These are in
%             units of the sample period.
%           f The normalized values of the frequency samples corresponding
%             to the columns of val. Multiply these by 1/(2*T0) to get the
%             actual frequency values, where T0 is the sampling period.
%
%The non-decimated function is based on Algorithm 4 in Section 5.3.2 of
%[2]. The "kernel" used is just 1. The decimated algorithm is algorithm 6
%of [2] and is only used if more than one inputs are provided to this
%function. The function real2ComplexSignalW is used to obtain the analytic
%signal when s is real, because the algorithm implemented there was shown
%in [2] and [3] to have less aliasing issues then Hough-transform based
%methods.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%Here, we consider an HFM chirp.
% fStart=3e3;
% fEnd=10e3;%10kHz
% 
% %Sampling rate is two times the Nyquist rate for the highest frequency.
% T0=1/(2*2*fEnd);%Sampling period in seconds.
% T=10e-3;%Chirp duration in seconds.
% 
% %Generate the real signal, here a chirp.
% xSig=real(HFMChirp(T,fStart,fEnd,T0));
% 
% [G,t,f]=WignerVilleDist(xSig);
% t=t*T0;
% f=f./(2*T0);
%

% set(h1,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')
% set(h2,'FontSize',14,'FontWeight','bold','FontName','Times')
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here we look at obtaining the energy of an LFM chirp.
% fStart=3e3;
% fEnd=10e3;%10kHz
% 
% %Sampling rate is two times the Nyquist rate for the highest frequency.
% T0=1/(2*2*fEnd);%Sampling period in seconds.
% T=10e-3;%Chirp duration in seconds.
% 
% %Generate the analytic signal, here a chirp.
% xSig=LFMChirp(T,fStart,fEnd,{T0});
% 
% G=WignerVilleDist(xSig);
% signalEnergy=2*T0*sum(sum(abs(G).^2))
% analyticEnergy=LFMChirpEnergy(T,fStart,fEnd)
%One will see that the signal energy from the Wigner-Ville transform and
%the analytic solution are aboth about 0.0050 Volt^2*seconds. That is, they
%agree. If one were to pass the real signal, the function used in
%WignerVilleDist to get the analytic signal reduces aliasing effects, but
%it also makes the power computation slightly less accurate.

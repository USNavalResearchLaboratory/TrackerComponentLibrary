%%LFMCHIRPENERGY Given the parameters for a linearly frequency modulated
%                (LFM) chirp signal, which can be an upchirp or a
%                downchirp, determine the scaled energy of the continuous-
%                time signal. For a signal x(t) going from time 0 to T, the
%                energy is the integral_0^T of x(t)^2 dt divided by the
%                magnitude of the load driven. Here, we omit the dividing
%                term, so the result is the scaled energy. For a signal in
%                Volts and the time of integration in sections, the output
%                is in Volt^2-seconds. Dividing that by resistance in Ohms
%                leads to an energy in Joules.
%
%INPUTS:  T The duration of the chirp (seconds).
%    fStart The positive frequency at the start of the chirp (Hertz).
%      fEnd The positive frequency at the end of the chirp (Hertz).
%       phi The phase offset of the chirp. If this parameter is omitted or
%           an empty matrix is passed, then the default of pi/2 is used,
%           which makes the real part of the signal start at zero.
%
%OUTPUT: val The scaled energy of the chirp.
%
%The time variable for integration is taken to be from 0 to T. The real
%passband chirp signal is assumed to have the form
%cos(2*pi*fStart*t+pi*alpha*t.^2+phi)
%where alpha=(fEnd-fStart)/T. This is consistent with the function
%LFMChirp. The solution was obtained by performing symbolic integration and
%simplifying the results to be in terms of Fresnel integrals. A special
%case is used for when alpha is negative so as to avoid taking the square
%roots of negative numbers.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%This example computes the energy a a chirp using this function and also
%computes a chirp using the LFMChirp function and this function
%approximates the energy using a Riemann sum. The answers are consistent
%with each other.
% B=20e3;%20kHz
% fStart=-(B/2);
% fEnd=(B/2);
% T=2e-3;%Chirp duration in seconds.
% chirpEnergy=LFMChirpEnergy(T,fStart,fEnd,0)
% 
% NyquistFreq=2*B;
% %Take samples high above the Nyquist rate for perfomring a Riemann sum.
% TSamp=1/(1000*NyquistFreq);
% [s,t]=LFMChirp(T,fStart,fEnd,{TSamp},0);
% deltaT=t(2)-t(1);
% RiemannSumApprox=sum(real(s).^2)*deltaT
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here, we find the energy in a 1ms chirp going from 1MHz to 10MHz with a
%phase offset of pi/2.
% T=1e-3;
% fStart=1e6;
% fEnd=10e6;
% phi=pi/2;
% val=LFMChirpEnergy(T,fStart,fEnd,phi)
%One will get a result of about 0.005 Volt^2*seconds assuming the signal is
%given in Volts.

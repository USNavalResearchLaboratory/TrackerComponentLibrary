function z=real2ComplexSignalW(s,returnPadded)
%%REAL2COMPLEXSIGNALW Given the real in-phase part of a signal, this
%          function returns a complex signal with in-phase and quadrature
%          parts. Unlike the function real2ComplexSignal, this function
%          uses the algorithm of [1] to produces an analytic signal that
%          has properties that help avoid aliasing issues when using the
%          Wigner-Ville transform.
%
%INPUTS: s The NX1 or 1XN real signal.
% returnPadded If true the analytic signal will be padded by N zeros.
%          Otherwise, just the length N analytic signal is returned. The
%          zero-padding is typically desired when computing the Wigner-Ville
%          transform. the default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed
%          is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: z The NX1 (or (2N)X1 is padded) complex analytic signal.The real
%           components of the first N elements will match (within finite-
%           precision bounds) the values of s.
%
%The algorithm is given in Section III of [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we demonstrate that the real components of the analytic signal match
%those of the original signal.
% x=randn(14,1);
% max(abs((real(real2ComplexSignalW(x))-x)./x))
%The returned value will be as close to 0 as one might expect within finite
%precision limits.

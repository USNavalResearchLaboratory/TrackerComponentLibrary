function PFA=OSCFARPFA4Threshold(T,N,k)
%%OSCFARPFA4THRESHOLD Determine the probability of false alarm in uniform
%           clutter when using the order-statistics constant false alarm
%           (OS-CFAR) detector with a simple exponential noise model as
%           used in [1].
%
%INPUTS: T The positive threshold to use for the CFAR detector. A matrix
%          of values can be passed in which case the output is a matrix
%          evaluated at each point.
%        N The total number of cells that contribute to the test region.
%          These are usually cells that are around the point being tested,
%          some distance outside of a guard region.
%        k The integer order to use k. That is, the kth largest sample in
%          the test region is used as the test statistic.
%
%OUTPUTS: PFA The false alarm probability associated with the given
%             parameters.
%
%This function implements Equation 37 of [1] with S=0. The function
%OSCFARThreshold4PFA is the inverse of this function.

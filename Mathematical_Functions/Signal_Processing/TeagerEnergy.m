function E=TeagerEnergy(x,dim)
%%TEAGERENERGY Compute the Teager energy of a discrete signal as defined in
%              [1]. The Teager energy is a type of instantaneous "energy"
%              signal that produces a result related to the rate of change
%              of the amplitude and frequency of the original signal. It
%              has found use in a number of applications, primarily related
%              to acoustic processing, such as in the wavelet-based speech
%              enhancement of [2].
%
%INPUTS: x A vector signal or a matrix of signals whose Teager energy is
%          desired.
%      dim The dimension of x over which the Teager energy is to be found.
%          For example, for a NXnumSigs set of signals, one would use
%          dims=1 as each column is a separate signal.
%
%OUTPUTS: E The Teager energy. This has the same size as x.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%Here we compute the Teager energy signal of an up-chirp followeb by a down
%chirp.
% fStart=10;
% fEnd=100;
% T=1;
% 
% %We want the chirp to be sampled at 100 times the Nyquist frequency.
% T0=1/(100*2*fEnd);%The sampling period.
% %We want to sample just the duration of the signal. Thus, time goes from
% %T=0 to T=1. This means that we need N=T/T0 samples.
% N=T/T0;
% 
% %Make a chirp up and then a chirp down
% [x1,t]=LFMChirp(T,fStart,fEnd,{T0});
% x2=LFMChirp(T,fEnd,fStart,{T0});
% x=real([x1(:);x2(:)]);
% t=[t(:);t(end)+t(2)-t(1)+t(:)];

%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here we compute the Teager energy of a sum of sinusoids. It essentially
%just follows the beat pattern.
% n=(0:100).';
% x=sin(pi/6*n)+sin(pi/4*n);

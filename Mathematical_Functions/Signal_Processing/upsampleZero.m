function y=upsampleZero(x,P)
%%UPSAMPLEZERO Increase the sampling rate of a signal by inserting zeros
%              in the new samples. This is often used as a first step in
%              interpolatory filters. Adding zeros between samples causes
%              the frequency response of the fft to be aliased. One can
%              then apply a window in the frequency domain and take the
%              ifft to get an interpolated signal. Just adding zeros
%              results in an interpolation with a lot of Gibbs phenomenon.
%
%INPUTS: x An NX1 or 1XN vector or an NXnumVec matrix to upsample. If it is
%          a matrix, then the values are taken per column to upsample. If
%          it is a vector, then the output will have the same orientation
%          as the input (column or row).
%        P The positive integer factor to upsample. P=1 returns the original
%          signal. 
%
%OUTPUTS: y The upsampled signal. If x is a vector, it will be (N*P)X1 or
%           1X(N*P), matching the input orientation. If a matrix, it will
%           be (N*P)XnumVec in size.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% x=1:5;
% P=3;%So there will be two zeros between each number.
% y=upsampleZero(x,P)

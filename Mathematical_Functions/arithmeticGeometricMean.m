function val=arithmeticGeometricMean(a,b)
%%ARITHMETICGEOMETRICMEAN Compute the arithmetic-geometric mean of two
%                   numbers. The arithmetic-geometric mean is used in a
%                   number of algorithms for computing transcendental
%                   functions such as complete elliptic integrals as
%                   described in [2].
%
%INPUTS: a,b Two real, positive scalar numbers whose arithmetic-geometric
%            mean is desired.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The arithmetic-geometric mean of a and b.
%
%The arithmetic-geometric mean is the iteration
%a_{n+1}=(a_n+b_n)/2; 
%b_{n+1}=sqrt(a_n*b_n);
%Until convergence as given in [1].
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%As noted at the end of Chapter 2.4 of [2], the quantity
%val=gamma(3/4)^4/arithmeticGeometricMean(1,1/sqrt(2))^2
%equals pi.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%As given in Section 1.2 of [2],
%1/arithmeticGeometricMean(1,x) is equal to
%(2/pi)*integral_0^{pi/2}1/sqrt(1-(1-x^2)*sin(theta)^2) dtheta
%Simplifying one finds that
%pi*sqrt(1/(1-x))/(2*arithmeticGeometricMean(1,sqrt(1/(1-x))))
%is equal to ellipke(x) for 0<x<1.
%Thus
% x=0.75;
% val1=pi*sqrt(1/(1-x))/(2*arithmeticGeometricMean(1,sqrt(1/(1-x))))
% val2=ellipke(x)
%One will find that val1=val2.
%
%EXAMPLE 3:
%In [1], they give a slightly different formula for expressing the complete
%elliptic integrals K. We implement that, relating their alpha parameter to
%the m parameter used in Matlab's built-in function ellipke, and we show
%that the relative error between the estimates is functionally zero.
% m=1/2;
% alpha=asin(sqrt(m));
% a=1;
% b=cos(alpha);
% c=sin(alpha);
% ellipKVal=pi/(2*arithGeoMean(a,b,c));
% ellipKValMatlab=ellipke(m);
% RelErr=(ellipKValMatlab-ellipKVal)/ellipKValMatlab

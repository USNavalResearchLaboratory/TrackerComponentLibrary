%%QUASINEWTONBFGS Perform unconstrained nonlinear optimization using the
%                 Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. The
%                 algorithm performs unconstrained minimization of a
%                 nonlinear function without one having to provide a
%                 Hessian matrix. Note that if a minimization over a
%                 least-squares problem is desired, then the
%                 Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in LSEstLMarquardt is
%                 often preferable. The limited memory version of thie
%                 algorithm, quasiNewtonLBFGS, is more appropriate for use
%                 with very large matrices. The L-BFGS algorithm also
%                 supports an additional L1 norm term in the objective
%                 function. If one wishes to zero a vector (not a scalar),
%                 then NewtonsMethod is more appropriate as this function
%                 assumes the Hessian matrix is symmetric.
%
%INPUTS: f A handle to the function (and its gradient) over which the
%          minimization is to be performed. The function [fVal,gVal]=f(x)
%          takes the NX1 x vector and returns the real scalar function
%          value fVal and gradient gVal at the point x.
%       x0 The NX1-dimensional point from which the minimization starts.
%       D0 An estimate of the inverse Hessian matrix at x0. If omitted or
%          an empty matrix is passed, then the identity matrix is used.
%  epsilon The parameter determining the accuracy of the desired solution
%          in terms of the gradient. The function terminates when
%          norm(g) < epsilon*max([1, norm(x)])
%          where g is the gradient. The default if omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passed is 1e-6.
% deltaTestDist The number of iterations back to use to compute the
%          decrease of the objective function if a delta-based convergence
%          test is performed. If zero, then no delta-based convergence
%          testing is done. The default if omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed is zero.
%    delta The delta for the delta convergence test. This determines the
%          minimum rate of decrease of the objective function. Convergence
%          is determined if (f'-f)<=delta*f, where f' is the value of the
%          objective function f deltaTestDist iterations ago,and f is the
%          current objective function value. The default if this parameter
%          is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is 0.
% lineSearchParams An optional structure whose members specify tolerances
%          for the line search. The parameters are described as in the
%          lineSearch function.
%   scaleD A boolean parameter indicating whether the inverse Hessian
%          estimate should be scaled as in Equation 1.201 of Section 1.7 of
%          [1]. The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is
%          false.
%  maxIter The maximum number of iterations to use for the overall BFGS
%          algorithm. The default if this parameter is omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passed is 1000.
%
%OUTPUTS: xMin The value of x at the minimum point found. If exitCode is
%              negative, then this might be an empty matrix.
%         fMin The cost function value at the minimum point found. If
%              exitCode is negative, then this might be an empty
%              matrix.
%     exitCode A value indicating the termination condition of the
%              algorithm. Nonnegative values indicate success; negative
%              values indicate some type of failure. Possible values are:
%                  0 The algorithm termiated successfully based on the
%                    gradient criterion.
%                  1 The algorithm terminated successfully based on the
%                    accuracy criterion.
%                 -1 The maximum number of overall iterations was reached.
%              Other negative values correspond to a failure in lineSearch
%              and correspond to the exitCode returned by the lineSearch
%              function. 
%
%The algorithm is implemented based on the description in Chapter 2.2 of
%[1] with the function lineSearch used to perform the line search.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%The first example is that used in the lineSearch file. 
% f=@(x)deal((x(1)+x(2)-3)*(x(1)+x(2))^3*(x(1)+x(2)-6)^4,... %The function
%            [(-6+x(1)+x(2))^3*(x(1)+x(2))^2*(54+8*x(1)^2+x(2)*(-45+8*x(2))+x(1)*(-45+16*x(2)));
%            (-6+x(1)+x(2))^3*(x(1)+x(2))^2*(54+8*x(1)^2+x(2)*(-45+8*x(2))+x(1)*(-45+16*x(2)))]);%And the gradient as the second return.
% %Note that the deal function is used to make an anonymous function have
% %two outputs.
% x0=[0.5;0.25];
% [xMin,fMin,exitCode]=quasiNetwonBFGS(f,x0)
%The optimum point found is such that sum(xMin) is approximately
%1.73539450 with a minimum function value of approximately -2.1860756.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%The second example requires that the cost function be placed in a separate
%file. The cost function is
% function [fx,g]=objFun(x)
%    n=length(x);
%    fx=0;
%   
%    g=zeros(n,1);
%    for i=0:(n-1)
%        if(mod(i,2)==1)
%            continue;
%        end
%        t1=1-x(i+1);
%        t2=10*(x(i+1+1)-x(i+1)^2);
%        g(i+1+1)=20*t2;
%        g(i+1)=-2*(x(i+1)*g(i+1+1)+t1);
%        fx =fx+t1^2+t2^2;
%    end
% end
%It is used as
% n=100;
% x0=zeros(n,1);
% for i=0:(n-1)
%    if(mod(i,2)==1)
%        continue;
%    end
%
%    x0(i+1)=-1.2;
%    x0(i+1+1)=1;
% end
% f=@(x)objFun(x);
% [xMin,fMin,exitCode]=quasiNetwonBFGS(f,x0)
%whereby the optimal solution is all ones with a minimum function value of
%zero. This second example is the same as that provided with the L-BFGS
%library in C.

function [zeroVal,exitFlag]=BrentRootFind(f,xSpan,AbsTol,maxIter)
%%BRENTROOTFIND Given two points that are of different signs
%          surrounding the root of a scalar funding, find the root of the
%          function using Brent's method. Brent's method is a combination
%          of bisection, linear interpolation and inverse quadratic
%          interpolation.
%
%INPUTS: f The handle to the function whose root is desired. The function
%          is called as f(x), where x is a scalar value.
%    xSpan A 2X1 or 1X2 vector such that
%          sign(f(xSpan(1)))~=sign(f(xSpan(2)))
%   AbsTol The absolute tolerance on the value of f for convergence, as
%          defined in [1]. The default if omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed is eps().
%  maxIter The maximum number of ierations to perform. The default if
%          omitted or an empty matrix is passed is 100.
%
%OUTPUTS: zeroVal This is the value of x at the zero point.
%        exitCode A value indicating how the function terminated. Possible
%                values are:
%                0 Either AbsTol was satisfied or the bounds on the value
%                  zeroVal went below finite precision constraints.
%                1 The maximum number of iterations occurred.
%
%This function implements the first algorithm described by Brent in [1].
%That is the zero algorithm.
%
%This function usually outperforms bisectionRootFind. However, if the
%function being zeroed is very flat over much of the bounded region, then
%this function might get stuck and return a bad value.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% f=@(x)(x.^2-4);
% xSpan=[0;5];
% [zeroVal,exitFlag]=BrentRootFind(f,xSpan)
%In this example convergence is to the exact root, zeroVal=2.

function [x,lambda,exitFlag]=constrainedLSSpher(A,b,alpha,varargin)
%%CONSTRAINEDLSSPHER Find x to minimize norm(A*x-b,2) under the constraint
%                    that norm(x,2)<=alpha. This is essentialy constraining
%                    x to a sphere of radius alpha. This only solves real
%                    systems.
%
%INPUTS: A A real mXn matrix with m>=n.
%        b A real mX1 vector.
%    alpha The inequality constraint value. If this parameter is omitted or
%          an empty matrix is passed, the default of 1 is used.
% varargin Any parameters that one might wish to pass to the fzero
%          function. These are generally comma-separated things, such as
%          'TolX',1e-12.
%
%OUTPUTS: x The optimal value of x subject to the spherical constraint.
%    lambda The Lagrangian multiplier used in the optimization. lambda>=0.
%           If lambda=0, then the constraint on x did not have to be
%           enforced.
%  exitFlag The exit flag from the fzero function, if used. Otherwise, this
%           is 0.
%
%This is an implementation of Algorithm 6.2.1 in Chapter 6.2.1 of [1]. The
%zero of the secular equation is found using the fzero function after
%bounding the equation.
%
%If after solving the unconstrained system norm(x)>alpha, then one must
%find the zero of a polynomial equation given in Algorithm 6.2.1 of [1].
%The equation is a sum of squared terms. Since this is an inequality
%constrained problem, we know that the Lagrangian multiplier must be >=0.
%The lower bound is thus 0. For an upper bound, we need to find a value of
%lambda that changes the sign of the objective function. To do this, we
%take the largest term in the sum and multiply it by r (r is the number of
%terms in the sum). Then, we find when the lambda for that to solve the
%optimization problem, multiply the result by 2 and we have an upper bound.
%Of course, we do not know which is the largest term, so we evaluate all of
%them and choose the largest.

%%LINPROGINTERIORPOINT Use the primal-dual interior point algorithm to
%                      solve a linear programming problem involving
%                      equality and/or inequality constraints. This solves
%                      the problem:
%                        minimize (maximize) c'*x
%                        given     A*x=b
%                              ALeq*x<=bLeq
%                                   x>=0
%                      The worst-case runtime of the interior point method
%                      is polynomial, though the algorithm is often slower
%                      than the simplex method, which has an exponential
%                      worst-case runtime.
%
%INPUTS: A An mXn matrix of equality constraints. If there are no equality
%          constraints, then use an empty matrix.
%        b A mX1 matrix of the right-hand of the equality constraints, or
%          an empty matrix if there are no equality cosntraints.
%     ALeq An mLeqXn matrix of the inequality constraints. If there  are no
%          inequality constraints, then use an empty matrix.
%     bLeq A mLeqX1 matrix of the right-hande of the inequality
%          constraints. or an empty matrix if there are no inequality
%          constraints.
%        c The nX1 cost vector.
% maximize A boolean variable specifying whether the problem is to maximize
%          or minimize the cost function. The default if omitted or an
%          empty matrix is passed is false.
%  maxIter An optional parameter specifying the maximum number of
%          iterations to use. The default if omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed is 1000. Complicated problems might require additional
%          iterations. However, finite precision limitations can also cause
%          large problems to get stuck and not terminate if the number of
%          iterations is not limited.
%  epsilon An optional parameter specifying a tolerance for declaring the
%          dot product of a dual vector with x as zero, which defines when
%          the algorithm has converged. The default value if omitted or an
%          empty matrix is passed is 1e-12.
%   alpha  A scaling value for the stepsizes. This must be between 0 and 1.
%          This affects convergence. Normally, the default value sufficies,
%          but some specific problems might not work well with the default
%          value. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the default
%          value of 0.5 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: optCost The optimal cost when the algorithm successfully
%                 terminates or when it terminates after having reached the
%                 maximum number of iterations. This is the minimum/maximum
%                 value of c'*x. If the algorithm did not terminate
%                 successfully, then an empty matrix is returned. If the
%                 cost is unbounded, then Inf or -Inf is returned.
%            xOpt The optimal vector x associated with the optimal cost. If
%                 the problem is unbounded or the algorithm did not
%                 terminate successfully, then an empty matrix is returned.
%                 To avoid finite precision issues, the elements of x will
%                 never be exactly zero.
%        exitCode A flag indicating the status upon termination. It can be
%                 0 Successful termination.
%                 1 The cost is unbounded based on c.
%                 2 Maximum number of iterations reached.
%                 3 A non-finite number was encountered. This is usually
%                   the result of the cost function being unbounded.
%
%The c vector can contain infinite elements to force a variable x to be
%zero. This is handled by finding such elements, removing them, and running
%the optimization on the reduced problem. Note that it is not checked
%whether setting the forbidden assignments to zero is inconsistent with the
%constraints.
%
%The constraints can be redundant. Redundant constraints are not checked
%for consistency.
%
%The algorithm is the infeasible primal-dual interior point method taken
%from Chapter 9.5 of [1] and has not been optimized for sparse matrices.
%Thus, on large, sparse problems, the algorithm can be slow.
%
%As an example, consider the 2D assignment problem. Given a rectangular
%cost matrix with more columns than rows, the goal is to choose one element
%per row, and at most one element per column so as to minimize the sum of
%the costs. Such a problem can be solved efficiently using the function
%[col4row, row4col, gain]=assign2D(C,false). However, it can also be solved
%using using a general linear programming solver, because it has been
%proven that the 0-1 constraint of assignments can be replaced with a
%non-negaitvity constraint without changing the optimal point.
%For example:
% C=[Inf,  2,Inf,Inf,3;
%      7,Inf, 23,Inf,Inf;
%     17, 24,Inf,Inf,Inf;
%    Inf,  6, 13, 20,Inf];
% %Turn the 2D assignment formulation into a linear programming
% %formulation.
% c=C(:);
% %The inequality constraints specify that each column is assigned to at
% %most one row.
% ALeq=kron(eye(5),ones(1,4));
% bLeq=ones(5,1);
% %The equality constraints spacify that each row is assigned to precisely
% %one column.
% A=kron(ones(1,5),eye(4));
% b=ones(4,1);
% %The problem is solved using
% [optCost,xOpt,exitCode]=linProgInteriorPoint(A,b,ALeq,bLeq,c)
% %To make the solution clearer, one can reshape the xOpt vector
% x=reshape(xOpt,4,5)
% %And the one's will be in the corresponding positions of the assigned
% elements of C, which can be compared to the output of the assign2D
% function.

%Before the algorithm, we could get rid of redundant constraints. However,
%doing so would also remove one constraint in a bounded region (unbounding
%the region). For example, if the constraints were of the form a<x<b, then
%getting rid of redundant constraints like

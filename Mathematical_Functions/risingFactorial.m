function val=risingFactorial(x,n,algorithm)
%%RISINGFACTORIAL Evaluate the rising factorial <x>_n, also denoted x^(n),
%                 and also known as the Pochhammer symbol. The rising
%                 factorial <x>_n=x*(x+1)*(x+2)*...*(x+n-1), where <x>_n=1.
%                 It can be expressed as gamma(x+n)/gamma(x), which makes
%                 it continuous. Other definitions can arise (but are not
%                 offered here) when considering negative non-integer
%                 values of n.
%
%OUTPUTS: x A scalar or matrix of first values in the product series of
%           x*(x+1)*...*(x+n-1). x must be real.
%         n The n value in the product series of x*(x+1)*...*(x+n-1). n
%           must be real.
% algorithm Optionally, one can specify the algorithm to use. If this
%           parameter is omitted, then algorithm 0 is used for positive
%           integer values of n, then algorithm 1 if x>0 and x+n>0,
%           otherwise algorithms 2 is used. The possible values are:
%           0 Use the product identity that is given in [1].
%           1 Use the expression in terms of gamma functions from [1], but
%             use gammaln to reduce the effects of possible overflows.
%           2 Use the expression in terms of gamma functions from [1]
%             directly using the gamma function.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The rising factorial <x>_n for each x and the corresponding
%             n or for each n and a single x depending on what is a matrix
%             and what is scalar.
%
%Rising factorials often arise when dealing with combinatorial problems and
%hypergeometric functions.
%
%The rising factorial is discussed in [1].
%Note that for positive integer n, risingFactorial(1,n)=factorial(n)

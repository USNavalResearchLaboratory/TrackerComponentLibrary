function val=HoelderMean(x,p,dim)
%%HOELDERMEAN Compute the Holder mean (the generalized mean, also known as
%             the power mean) of a set of numbers. The Holder mean of n
%             numbers equals
%             ((1/n)*sum_{=1}^n x_i)^(1/p)
%             Special cases are p=-Inf (minimum), p=Inf (maximum), p=-1
%             (harmonic mean), p=0 (geometric mean), p=1 (arithmetic mean)
%             and p=2 (root mean squared).
%
%INPUTS: x The set of samples over which the Holder mean is to be found.
%          How the function handles vectors and matrices is determined by
%          the parameter dim.
%        p The positive or negative exponent of the mean as described
%          above. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, p=1 is used.
%      dim An optional parameter specifying over which dimension of x the
%          Holder mean is to be taken. If dim is omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passsed, then if x is a vector, the Holder mean is
%          found over all elements of the vector. If x is a matrix, then
%          the mean is found over the columns of the matrix (resulting in a
%          row vector), and if x is an n-dimensional (n>2) matrix, then the
%          Holder mean is found over the first non-singleton dimension
%          of the matrix.
%
%OUTPUT: val The Holder mean of x taken over the appropriate dimension with
%            the exponent p.
%
%The Holder mean is described in [1]. For the case of n=0, the function
%geometricMean is called.

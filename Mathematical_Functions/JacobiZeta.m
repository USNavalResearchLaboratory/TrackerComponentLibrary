function intVal=JacobiZeta(beta,m)
%%JACOBIZETA Evaluate Jacobi's zeta function. This is defined to be
%            Z(beta,m)=E(beta|m)-E(pi/2,m)/F(pi/2,m)*F(beta|m), where F is
%            the incomplete elliptic integral fo the first kind and E is
%            the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind. The
%            Jacobi zeta function is often denoted b Z. The function arises
%            in various obscure scenarios, such as in [2].
%
%INPUTS: beta, m The two real or complex parameters of the Jacobi zeta
%                function.
%
%OUTPUTS: intVal The scalar value of the Jacobi zeta function with the
%                given parameters.
%
%This function implements the formula given in Equation 63 of [1].

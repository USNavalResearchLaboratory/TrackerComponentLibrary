function val=numInvolutions(n)
%%NUMINVOLUTIONS Determine the number of involutions of length n. An
%                involution is a permution of items 1:n such that the
%                permutation is its own inverse. The number of involutions
%                also equals the number of possible standard Young tableau
%                having n cells.
%
%INPUTS: n A positive integer >=0.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The number of involutions of length n. For n=0, this is
%             defined as 1.
%
%This function uses the recurrence relation given in Equation 40 in Section
%5.1.4 of [1].

function allCombos=genAllCapacitatedCombos(numPerBin,numBins,totalItems)
%%GENALLCAPACITATEDCOMBOS Given totalItems items, generate all combinations
%               of placing the items into numBins unlabeled bins where each
%               bin can hold numPerBin items. If numPerBin=1, then this is
%               just generating standard combinations of numBins items
%               taken from a total of totalItems. The capacitated
%               combinations are equivalent to putting totalItems labeled 
%               balls into numBins unlabeled bins such that each bin holds
%               numPerBin items and the ordering of the items in the bins
%               does not matter.
%
%INPUTS: numPerBin The scalar integer capacity of the bins; numPerBin>=1.
%          numBins The scalar integer number of bins; numBins>=1.
%       totalItems The scalar integer total number of items to place in the
%                  bins; totalitems>=numBins*numPerBin. If omitted or an
%                  empty matrix is passed, then the default of 
%                  totalItems=numBins*numPerBin is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: allCombos The numPerBinXnumBinsXnumCapCombos set of capacitated
%                   combinations. allCombos(:,:,i) is the ith capacitated
%                   combination. The rows are the items in each bin and the
%                   columns are the bins. Items are numbered from 1 to
%                   totalItems.
%
%If we assume that totalItems=n=numPerBin*numBins, then we can generate the
%combinations by fixing the first element of each bin to the smallest index
%unassigned to any previous bin in the current combination being
%constructed. Thus, the first bin will always contain item 1. The second
%bin will always contain the smallest unassigned item that is not in the
%first bin and so on. Thus, we have to go through standard
%(n-(k-1)*numPerBin-1) choose (numPerBin-1) combinations of the remaining
%indices for the kth bin conditioned on the previous bins. This function
%implements a non-recursive algorithm for generating such combinations.
%
%In the general case, if totalItems>n, then we have to additionally go
%through all possible combinations of n items chosen from totalItems. This
%means generating all combinations as if totalItems=n and then remapping
%the indices for each subset of n items from totalItems.
%
%A total of numCapacitatedCombos(numPerBin,numBins,totalItems) capacitated
%combinations will be produced. Note that the number of capacitated
%combinations can grow rapidly and one might prefer visiting them
%sequentially using getNextCapacitatedCombo rather than generating all of
%them at once.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here we put six items into two bins of capacity 3:
% allCombos=genAllCapacitatedCombos(3,2,6)
%One wil get 10 combinations:
% allCombos(:,:,1)=[1, 4;
%                   2, 5;
%                   3, 6];
% allCombos(:,:,2)=[1, 3;
%                   2, 5;
%                   4, 6];
% allCombos(:,:,3)=[1, 3;
%                   2, 4;

%                   4, 3;

%                   4, 3;
%                   6, 5];

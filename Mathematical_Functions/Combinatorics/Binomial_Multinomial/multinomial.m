function val=multinomial(repList)
%%MULTINOMIAL Compute a multinomial coefficient. The multinomial
%           coefficient is the number of permutation of a multiset. A
%           multiset is a set with repeated elements. Multinomial
%           coefficients are usually written like binomial coefficients but
%           with multiple terms below.
%
%INPUTS: repList A numUniqueX1 list of how many times each unique item in
%                the multiset is repeated. All elements >=1 and
%                n=sum(repList), where n is the total number of elements in
%                the multiset.
%
%OUTPUTS: val The value of the multinomial coefficient.
%
%The multinomial coefficient is factorial(n)/prod(factorial(repList)).
%However, that formulation is subject to overflow issues. Thus, it is
%implemented here as a product of binomial coefficients.

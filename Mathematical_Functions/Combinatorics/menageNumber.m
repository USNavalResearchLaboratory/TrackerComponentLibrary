function An=menageNumber(n)
%%MENAGENUMBER Get the nth menage number. This is the number of ways that n
%       married couples can be seated around a circular table such that
%       there is always one man between two women and no man is next to his
%       own wife.
%
%INPUTS: n The integer number of couples that are to be seated. n>=2.
%
%OUTPUTS: An The number of seating arrangements such that each man is
%            always seated between two women.
%
%The problem is solved using Laisant's recurrence formula, which is derived
%in Chapter 8 of [1].

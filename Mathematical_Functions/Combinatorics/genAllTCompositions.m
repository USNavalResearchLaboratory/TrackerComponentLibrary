function tuples=genAllTCompositions(n,t,algorithm)
%%genAllTGENALLTCOMPOSITIONS Find all permutations of t positive (nonzero)
%                   integers that sum to a given constant n (constant-sum
%                   t-tuples). That is, find all compositions of n into t
%                   parts such that no part is ever empty. There is a total
%                   of binomial(n-1,t-1) compositions.
%
%INPUTS: n The integer value that the sum of the elements of the vectors
%          should have.
%        t The integer dimensionality of the vectors of integers to
%          generate.
% algorithm An optional parameter specifying which algorithm to use to
%          generate the compositions. Possible values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use the
%            relation described in Section 7.2.1.3 of [1] for mapping
%            combinations to compositions.
%          1 Use  Algorithm 8.1.1 of [1], which is also given in Appendix C
%            of [2].
%
%OUTPUTS: tuples A tXnumTuples matrix of column vectors such that the sum
%                across rows for each column equals n. All elements are
%                >=1. If n<t, then an empty matrix is returned. There is a
%                total of numTuples=binomial(n-1,t-1);
%
%Often, one might prefer all partitions of t integers that sum to a
%constant value n INCLUDING zeros. This function can be used to
%produce such a modified set of partitions as
%tuples=genAllTCompositions(n+t,t)-1;
%
%To preallocate the array, one has to know the total number of tuples that
%sum to a particular value. To determine the total number of possible
%tuples:
%Consider a series of n ones. One has to place t-1 commas between
%them. These t-1 commas partition the set into t subsets. The sums of the t
%subsets are the values of an element in a tuple. This means that there are
%consequently binomial(n-1,t-1) possible tuples.
%
%One can observe that for t=3, starting with n=3 and going up, the number
%of tuples is given by triangular numbers. For t=4, increasing n from 4,
%one gets tetrahedral numbers; for t=5, increasing n from 5, one gets
%pentatope numbers. One can see the pattern of figurate numbers arising
%from the number of possible tuples that sum to a given value.

function compList=genAllTCompositions0(n,t)
%%GENALLTCOMPOSITIONS Generate all compositions of n unlabeled items in t
%                   parts. That is, a method of putting n unlabeled balls
%                   into t labeled slots. Compositions are tuples of n
%                   integers >=1 that sum to t. 
%
%INPUTS: n The number of items that are composed into slots, >=1; n>=t.
%        t The number of slots that can hold items, >=1.

%OUTPUTS: compList A tXnumComp matrix of the compositions.

%This is an implementation of the relation described in Section 7.2.1.3 of

/*GETNEXTCOMBO A C++ function to return the next combination in
*              lexicographic order given the current combination. If the
*              final combination in the sequence has been reached, then an
*              empty matrix is returned. The first element in the
*              combination is the least significant element for defining
*              the lexicographic order.
*
*INPUTS: I The rX1 or 1Xr current combination of r elements. The next
*          combination in lexicographic order is desired. The first element
*          is the least significant and one begins with I=[0;1;2;...;r-1]
*          is startVal=0 and I=[1;2;3;...;r] if startVal=1.
*        n The number of items from which r items are chosen for
*          combinations. The elements of I can range from 0 to n-1. if
*          startVal=0 or they range from 1 to n if startVal=1.
* startVal This is zero or 1, indicating which value the value at which the
*          elements in I can start. The default if omitted or an empty
*          matrix is passed is 0.
*
*OUTPUTS: I The next combination in the lexicographic sequence, or an
*           empty matrix if the final combination in the lexicographic
*           ordering is provided.
*
* This function can be useful for generating combinations when used in a
* loop. It is more computationally efficient than sequentially unranking
* the combinations. If the final combination is put in, an empty matrix
* will be returned.
*
* The algorithm is from [1].
*
* The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
* CompileCLibraries function.
*
* The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
* I=getNextCombo(I,n)

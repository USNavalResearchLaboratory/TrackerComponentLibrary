function retVal=permUBound(A,algorithm)
%%PERMUBOUND Calculate an upper bound to the matrix permanent. This bound
%           might be useful when approximating target-measurement
%           association probabilities using matrix permanents. The bound
%           tends to be a poor approximation of the matrix permanent.
%           However, a ratio of bounds is used in tracking, and the ratio
%           can be comparably accurate.
%
%INPUTS: A An mXn matrix. If m<=n, then the standard matrix permanent bound
%          is found. If m>n, then the permanent bound of A' is found to be
%          consistent with the permanents of A and A' being equal in square
%          matrices. Empty matrices have a permanent of one by definition.
% algorithm An optional selecting the algorithm to use. Possible values
%          are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use a
%            modified version of the matrix approximation e4 described in
%            [1].
%          1 Use the Hadamard-type bound that is given in Lemma 4.1a in
%            [2].
%          2 Use the Bregman-Minc bound that is given in Lemma 4.1b in [2].
%            This bound is only valid if A has binary elements.
%
%OUTPUTS: val An approxmation of the matrix permanent of A.
%
%In the case of a zero column sum, the e4 permanent bound in [1] by column
%is very loose, but the same approximation by row is good. In general,
%since the bound is an upper bound regardless of whether it is taken by row
%or by column, it should be evaluated both by row and by column and the
%smaller value should be taken. That is what is done in the implementation
%of algorithm 0.
%
%In [1] "conditioning techniques" for the matrix under question before
%finding the bound on the permanent are discussed. No conditioning is done
%here.
%
%When given an mXn rectangular matrix with n>m (more rows than columns),
%the matrix permanent is the sum of all permanents of all possible square
%matrices formed by choosing m columns. Thus, the matrix permanent
%upper bound here for rectangular matrices is obtained through a similar
%sum. For the case of m>n, the permanent bound of the transposed matrix is
%returned. The permanent of an empty matrix is defined to be one.

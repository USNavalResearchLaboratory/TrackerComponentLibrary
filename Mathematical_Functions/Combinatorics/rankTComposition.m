function theRank=rankTComposition(p,firstElMostSig)
%%RANKTCOMPOSITION Obtain the lexicographic order (the rank) of a particular
%                 composition starting at 0. A composition of n into t
%                 is a way of putting n unlabeled balls into t labeled
%                 slots. Compositions are tuples of t integers >0 that
%                 sum to n. Compositions are given in lexicographic order
%                 where the first element is the least significant unless
%                 otherwise specified.
%
%INPUTS: p An tX1 vector holding the current composition, whose elements
%          sum to n>=1.
% firstElMostSig An optional parameter specifying whether the first element
%          is the most or least significant. The default if omitted or an
%          empty matrix is passed is false (the first element is the least
%          significant).
%
%OUTPUTS: theRank The rank of the composition in a lexicographic ordering
%                 of compositions, counting from zero. There is a total of
%                 binomial(n-1,t-1) compositions. Lexicographic ordering is
%                 defined using p(1) as the least significant element.
%
%This is an implementation of the relation described in Chapter 7.2.1.3 of
%[1] for mapping combinations to compositions. However, a special case is
%if the input is one-dimensional. In such an instance, the rank is always
%0.

function prodVal=numCapacitatedCombos(numPerBin,numBins,totalItems)
%%NUMCAPACITATEDCOMBOS Given totalItems items, find the number of
%               combinations of placing the items into numBins unlabeled
%               bins where each bin can hold numPerBin items. If
%               numPerBin=1, then this is just counting standard
%               combinations of numBins items taken from a total of
%               totalItems. This is the number of ways of putting
%               totalItems labeled balls into numBins unlabeled bins such
%               that each bin holds numPerBin items and the ordering of the
%               items in the bins does not matter.
%
%INPUTS: numPerBin The scalar integer capacity of the bins; numPerBin>=1.
%          numBins The scalar integer number of bins; numBins>=1.
%       totalItems The scalar integer total number of items to place in the
%                  bins; totalitems>=numBins*numPerBin. If omitted or an
%                  empty matrix is passed, then the default of 
%                  totalItems=numBins*numPerBin is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: prodVal The number of ways of placing totalItems items into
%                 numBins unlabeled bins each holding numperBin items,
%                 where the ordering of the items in the bins does not
%                 matter.
%
%If we assume that totalItems=n=numPerBin*numBins, then we can count by
%fixing the first element of each bin to the smallest index unassigned
%to any previous bin in the current combination being constructed. Thus,
%the first bin will always contain item 1. The second bin will always
%contain the smallest unassigned item that is not in the first bin
%and so on. Thus, we have to choose
%binomial(n-(k-1)*numPerBin-1,numPerBin-1) for the kth bin conditioned on
%the previous bins. So, the total number of ways of distributing the items
%across the bins is the product of those binoial terms from k=1 to
%numBins-1 (the last bin only has one way of inserting things, because we
%assume that (totalItems=numPerBin*numBins).
%
%For the case where totalItems>numPerBin*numBins, so totalItems~=n, we take
%the previously found quantity and multiply it by binomial(totalItems,n)
%which is the number of ways of choosing which subset of the totalItems
%items will be put into the bins.
%
%This is equaivalent to calling multinomial(repList)/factorial(numBins)
%with repList=[numPerBin*ones(1,numBins),totalItems-numPerBin*numBins] .

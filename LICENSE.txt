LICENSE for the Tracker Component Library, Version 6.1.1

All of the data included is in the public domain and was obtained from U.S
Government servers, with the exceptions of the Hipparcos 2 Catalog, the
Earth2014 model, and the GSHHG model. The Earth2014 model was produced by
researchers at Curtin University in Australia. The file
"./Terrain/data/Earth2014 License.txt" shows the statement provided
declaring it to be in the public domain. The Hipparcos 2 catalog is
maintained by the European Space Agency at
http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/hipparcos/home
The catalog forms the basis of a number of international standards and is
in the public domain, as verified by the Hipparcos helpdesk, whose contact
information is available at the aforementioned web site. Data for the GSHHG
model is generally not distributed with the library and is under a license
with a weak copyleft, as noted on
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/

All of the source code in the 3rd_Party_Libraries folder has copyleft-free
licenses, which are included with the code. The other source code is either
not subject to copyright (because it was made entirely by US government
employees) or is present under an MIT license.

Code that is not subject to copyright has the following license written at
the bottom of each file:

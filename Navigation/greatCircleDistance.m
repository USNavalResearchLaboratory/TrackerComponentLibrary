%%GREATCIRCLEDISTANCE Given the spherical latitudes and longitudes of two
%       points on a reference sphere, determine the distance between them
%       across the surface of the sphere.
%
%INPUTS: latLon1 The 2XN set of N first points given in latitude and
%                longitude in radians in the format [latitude;longitude]
%                (on a reference sphere, latitude is spherical elevation;
%                longitude is spherical azimuth). If all these points are
%                the same but latLon2 varies, then a single 2X1 vector can
%                be passed.
%        latLon2 The 2XN second points given in latitude and longitude in
%                radians in the format [latitude;longitude]. If all these
%                points are the same but latLon1 varies, then a single 2X1
%                vector can be passed.
%             rE The assumed radius of the spherical Earth model. If
%                omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the default of
%                rE=osculatingSpher4LatLon(latLon1) is used.
%    formula2Use This optional value specified the formula to use for the
%                conversion. Possible values are:
%                0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed)
%                  Convert the points into unit vectors and use the Earth's
%                  radius times the angular distance between them (via
%                  angBetweenVecs) to get the distance across the Earth.
%                  This is more accurate than the other method.
%                1 Use the cosine formula that is implicit in Equations
%                  13-15 in [1].
%
%OUTPUTS: distVal The scalar distance between the points.
%   
%EXAMPLE:
%This example just shows that when the points are far apart, the two
%formula field essentially the same distance (relative error on the order
%of eps). However, when the points are very close, the relative difference
%between the distance formula increases significantly.
% latLon1=deg2rad([19.7241;-155.0868]);
% latLon2=deg2rad([48.8566;2.3522]);
% latLon3=deg2rad([19.7240;-155.0867]);
% d0=greatCircleDistance(latLon1,[latLon2,latLon3],[],0);
% d1=greatCircleDistance(latLon1,[latLon2,latLon3],[],1);
% RelDiff12=(d1-d0)./d0

function [latLonEnd,azEnd]=directGeodeticProbGen(latLonStart,azStart,dist,height,useHeightApprox,a,f,numSteps4Circ)
%%DIRECTGEODETICPROBGEN Solve the direct geodetic problem. That is, given
%                     an initial point and an initial bearing an
%                     ellipsoidal Earth, find the end point and final
%                     bearing if one were to travel one or more given
%                     distances along a geodesic curve (the shortest curve
%                     between two points on a curved surface). This
%                     function is general in that it will also solve the
%                     direct geodetic problem at a fixed height above the
%                     reference ellipsoid, if desired.
%
%INPUTS: latLonStart A 2XN matrix of N starting points given in geodetic 
%                   latitude and longitude in radians. that is, each column
%                   is [latitude;longitude]; 
%           azStart An NX1 or 1XN vector of the forward azimuth (initial
%                   headings) at the starting point in radians East of true
%                   North on the reference ellipsoid.
%              dist An NX1 or 1XN vector of the distances in meters 
%                   that will be traveled on the geodesic curve starting at
%                   latLonStart with initial heading azStart where
%                   solutions are desired.
%            height An NX1 or 1XN vector of the heights above the reference
%                   ellipsoid at which the trajectories should be
%                   determined. If this parameter is omitted, then the
%                   default value of 0 is used for all of the trajectories.
%   useHeightApprox If true, and the height is not zero, then a distance
%                   scaling height approximation is used. An equatorial
%                   trajectory traveling a distance dist at a height h
%                   above the reference ellipsoid will only travel
%                   a/(a+h)*dist over the surface. If useHeightApprox is
%                   true, then this scaling applied to any trajectry
%                   (including non-equatorial). If useHeightApprox is
%                   false, a slow iterative optimization used. The default
%                   value if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is
%                   false. This parameter is ignored if height=0.
%                 a The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid (in
%                   meters). If this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%                 f The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If
%                   this argument is omitted, the value in
%                   Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%     numSteps4Circ If height!=0, and useHeightApprox=false, then an
%                   algorithm propagating a state in ECEF coordinates
%                   around the curved Earth is used. This parameter
%                   determines the number of steps that would be needed
%                   for a target that circumnavigates the globe around the
%                   equator. The default value if this parameter is not
%                   provided is 2000. A value of 6000 appears to be about
%                   the best number for overall precision. Reducing the
%                   number of steps will speed up the function. This
%                   parameter is not used if height=0.
%
%OUTPUTS: latLonEnd A 2XN matrix of geodetic latitude and longitudes of the
%                  final points of the geodesic trajectory given in radians
%                  as [latitude;longitude].
%            azEnd An NX1 vector of the forward azimuth (bearing) at the
%                  ending points in radians East of true North on the
%                  reference ellipsoid.
%
%For zero-altitude, the directGeodeticProb function is called. The solution
%for a non-zero height is based on [1]. The function is significantly
%faster if a zero height is used or if useHeightApprox=true, in which case
%the approximation described in [2] is used.
%
%The algorithm is generally the opposite of indirectGeodeticProbGen.

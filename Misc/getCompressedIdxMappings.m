%%GETCOMPRESSEDIDXMAPPINGS Given a matrix holding a set of hypotheses
%       of assigned measurements at each dimension of an S-dimensional
%       assignment, obtain a mapping of the indices of the measurements
%       at each dimension to one that has no gaps. For example, if in
%       the first dimension, hypotheses contain measurements 1, 3, 4,
%       and 5, these would be remapped to indices 1,2,3, and 4 (the
%       gap between 1 and 3 is eliminated). At the same time, create a
%       matrix to perform the inverse mapping from the compressed
%       indices to the spread out indices. The zero index is assumed to
%       be the missed detection hypothesis and thus is not considered
%       for remapping (it implicitly does not change). Also, this function
%       can handle the case of multiple groups of hypotheses with regions
%       between them that should be ignored.
%
%INPUTS: theHypIdxHist A numDimsXnumHyps collection of numDims-length
%             assignment indices across multiple hypotheses. All of the
%             values must be >=0. If hypotheses come in groups with gaps
%             between them, then the next two inputs must be provided.
% numSec, numPartsPerSec, secLength If these two inputs are provided, it
%             means that theHypIdxHist does not contain all hypotheses in a
%             contiguous manner, but rather that there are numSec sections
%             of length secLength where the ith section contains
%             numPartsPerSec(i) hypotheses. To see how this is used, look
%             at the second example below.
%
%OUTPUTS: numMeasPerScan A 1XnumDims vector where numMeasPerScan(i) is
%             the number of unique indices in theHypIdxHist(i,:). Zero
%             indices present in theHypIdxHist do not count.
%     measMap A max(numMeasPerScan)XnumDims matrix of how compressed
%             indices map to the global indices in theHypIdxHist.
%             measMap(i,j) is how the ith compressed index in the jth
%             dimension maps to a measurement index in jth dimension of
%             theHypIdxHist.
%  invMeasMap This is the inverse map of measMap. This is a
%             maxMeasPerScanXnumDims matrix such that if one takes an
%             index idx from the jth dimension of theHypIdxHist, it
%             maps to the compressed indices as invMeasMap(idx,j),
%             assuming that idx~=0.
%
%Index compression can be useful when using algorithms that like
%sequential indexation of things, but where pruning may have removed a
%large number of indices.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%We compress and then decompress some indices where no sections are
%skipped.

%                0,2,2,0;
%                1,20,2,0;
%                4,6,3,0];
% [numMeasPerScan,measMap,invMeasMap]=getCompressedIdxMappings(theHypIdxHist);
% %Remap the indices in theHypIdxHist (ignoring zero indices) based on the
% %previded information.
% numDim=size(theHypIdxHist,1);
% numHyp=size(theHypIdxHist,2);

%         if(origIdx>0)
%             theHypIdxHist(curDim,curHyp)=invMeasMap(origIdx,curDim);
%         end
%     end
% end
% %View the remapped indices. See that there are no gaps in each dimension.
% theHypIdxHist
% 
% %Map the indices back to their original state.
% for curHyp=1:numHyp
%     for curDim=1:numDim 
%         modIdx=theHypIdxHist(curDim,curHyp);
%         if(modIdx~=0)

%         end
%     end
% end
% %See that the original indices have returned.

%%EXAMPLE 2:
%This is an example of a scenario with two targets where we want the
%compressed index mapping. We set the unused parts of each section to NaNs.
%The NaNs are not even looked at by the algorithm and thus do not
%contribute to the unique index determination.

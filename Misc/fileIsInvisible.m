function boolVal=fileIsInvisible(path)
%%FILEISINVISIBLE  Given a full path to a file or folder, indicate whether
%                  the path appears to go through invisible folders or
%                  whether the folder/ file is invisible based on the names
%                  of the folders in the path and the filename.
%
%INPUTS: path The path to the file. For example, '/test.txt'. The path
%             should be UNIX-style with '/' to indicate folders, not '\'.
%
%OUTPUTS: boolVal True if the file is invisible or is a folder based on the
%                 path.
%
%This function does not check the metadata of the file/ of the folders in
%the path. Thus, a file marked as invisible using HFS+ flags will not
%appear to be invisible. Rather, this function looks for common indicators
%in the path and filename that indicate that the file is invisible. If a
%foldername or the filename begin with __ or ., then the file is assumed to
%be invisible. The beginning of a folder name/ filename that is not at the
%beginning of the path is identified by a / character that has not been
%escaped by a \ character.
%
%This function is useful when decompressing zip files that were compressed
%under Mac OS X, where a bunch of .DS_Store files indicating window
%placement and a __MACOSX folder holds metadata associated with the files.
%Often, one does not care about any of that and would prefer to just not
%decompress thoe files at all.

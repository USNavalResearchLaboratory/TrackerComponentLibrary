function [hashVal,hexVal]=genHashVal(inputArray,algorithm)
%%GENHASHVAL  Get a hash value of a character string or a 1D array of
%             bytes. That is, integer values from 0 through 255. The hash
%             value can either be a simple integer value, useful for quick
%             comparison of strings, or one can get a cryptographic hash as
%             an an array of integers from 0 to 255 using various
%             algorithms. Cryptographic hashes are also returned has
%             hexadecimal strings.
%
%INPUTS: inputArray A 1-dimensional string of characters or array of
%                   integer values from 0 to 255 for which one desires a
%                   hash code.
%        algorithm  An optional  string specifying the algorithm to use to
%                   generate the hash. Possible values are
%                   'simple' (the default) Use a simple, non-cryptographic
%                            hash function to get a single integer hash for
%                            the input.
%                   'MD2'    Use the MD2 algorithm to get a weak 
%                            cryptographic hash, along with its hexidecimal
%                            string.
%                   'MD5'    Use the MD5 algorithm to get a weak 
%                            cryptographic hash, along with its hexidecimal
%                            string.
%                   'SHA-1'  Use the SHA-1 algorithm to get a cryptographic
%                            hash along with its hexidecimal string.
%                  'SHA-384' Use the SHA-384 algorithm to get a
%                            cryptographic hash along with its hexidecimal
%                            string.
%                  'SHA-256' Use the SHA-256 algorithm to get a
%                            cryptographic hash along with its hexidecimal
%                            string.
%                  'SHA-512' Use the SHA-512 algorithm to get a
%                            cryptographic hash along with its hexidecimal
%                            string.
%
%OUTPUTS: hashVal  If algorithmis 'simple', then this is an integer hash
%                  code for the given input. Otherwise, it is an array of
%                  bytes representing the hash value.
%         hexVal   A hexidecimal string representing the hash value. 
%
%The simple algorithm is executed using the hashCode method in Java's
%java.lang.String class. The cryptographic hashes are executed using the
%java.security.MessageDigest class. In Matlab, one can directly access Java
%functions, which is what was done to implement this function.

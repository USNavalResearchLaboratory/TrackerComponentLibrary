/**SETPROCROUNDINGMODE Set the rounding mode used in the processor. This
 *                     specifies how results should be truncated to a
 *                     finite number of bits when performing floating point
 *                     arithmetic. Control of the rounding mode is useful
 *                     when implementing routines utilizing interval
 *                     algebra. Note that this does not appear to change
 *                     the rounding mode used in other mex files called
 *                     from Matlab. When running things in parallel, the 
 *                     rounding mode will have to be set for each parallel
 *                     process. For example, set it at the start of a
 *                     parfor loop, not outside the loop.
 *
 *INPUTS: roundMode An integer specifying the rounding mode to use.
 *                  Possible values are
 *                  0 Rounding is done towards negative infinity.
 *                  1 Rounding is done towards zero.
 *                  2 Rounding is done to the nearest value.
 *                  3 Rounding is done towards positive infinity.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: retVal This is zero if the rounding direction was successfully
 *                set and a nonzero value (corresponding to the outout of
 *                fesetround in C) otherwise.
 *
 *The rounding modes are standardized in [1]. The native Matlab version of
 *this function calls the undocumented system_dependent('setround',dir)
 *function in Matlab. The version that can be compiled in C just calls the
 *standard C function fesetround.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *retVal=setProcRoundingMode(roundMode);
 *
 *EXAMPLE:
 *  setProcRoundingMode(0);
 *  1+eps(0)>1
 *  %The result should be false (0).
 *  setProcRoundingMode(3);
 *  1+eps(0)>1
 *  %The result should be true (1).

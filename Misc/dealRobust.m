function varargout=dealRobust(varargin)
%%DEALROBUST The deal function in Matlab takes a variable number of inputs
%            in and then outputs them as the same number of outputs. The
%            function is useful when creating anonymous functions to pass
%            to other functions. However, the deal function will throw an
%            error if the function calling the anonymous function asks for
%            fewer outputs than are passed. For example, this might arise
%            if a routine wants a passed function handle to return a value
%            and its derivative, but the calling function does not need the
%            derivative at some point and only requests the value. This
%            function is the same as Matlab's deal function, except it does
%            not throw an error if fewer outputs are requested than inputs
%            passed.
%
%INPUTS: A variable number of items that must be at least as large as the
%        number of outputs requested.
%
%OUTPUTS: The outputs are the same as the inputs.

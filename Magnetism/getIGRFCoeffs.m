function [C,S,a,c]=getIGRFCoeffs(year,fullyNormalize)
%%GETIGRFCOEFFS Obtain spherical harmonic coefficients for the
%               14th generation International Geomagnetic Reference Field
%               (IGRF) at a particular time or at the latest reference
%               epoch. Note that the coefficients must be adjusted for
%               local magnetization effects (buildings, cars, power lines,
%               ionospheric currents) in order to hope to obtain something
%               close to what a local measurement might provide.
%
%INPUTS: year A decimal number indicating a year in the Gregorian
%             calendar as specified by universal coordinated time (UTC).
%             For example, halfway through the year 2013 would be
%             represented as 2013.5. The precision of the model is not
%             sufficiently fine that leap seconds matter. If this parameter
%             is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then the reference
%             year of the IGRF model is used. In this instance, 2025.0. For
%             predicting the magnetic field into the future, it is
%             suggested that one use the World Magnetic Model (WMM) not the
%             IGRF.
% fullyNormalize Geomagnetic models are normally given in terms of Schmidt
%             semi-normalized Legendre functions. If fullyNormalize =true,
%             then the coefficients are converted for use with fully
%             normalized associated Legendre functions, as are commonly
%             used with spherical harmonic algorithms for gravitational
%             models. If this parameter is omitted, the default value is
%             true.
%
%OUTPUTS: C An array holding the coefficient terms that are multiplied by
%           cosines in the harmonic expansion. This can be given to a
%           CountingClusterSet class so that C(n+1,m+1) is the coefficient
%           of degree n and order m. The coefficients have units of Tesla.
%           The coefficients are normalized according to the fullyNormalize
%           term.
%         S An array holding the coefficient terms that are multiplied by
%           sines in the harmonic expansion. The format of S is the same as
%           that of C.
%         a The numerator in the (a/r)^n term in the spherical harmonic sum
%           having units of meters.
%         c The constant value by which the spherical harmonic series is
%           multiplied, having units of squared meters.
%
%Details on the normalization of the coefficients is given in the comments
%to the function spherHarmonicEval.
%
%Documentation for the IGRF model is given in [1] and information on
%Schmidt semi-normalized Legendre functions is given in [2]. The
%coefficients originate from
%https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-geomagnetic-reference-field
%and being created by the government are not subject to copyright
%protection.
%
%Note that the IGRF is not a crustal magnetic model; it is just the main
%field of the Earth.

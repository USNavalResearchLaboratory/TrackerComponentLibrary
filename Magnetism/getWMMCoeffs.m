function [C,S,a,c]=getWMMCoeffs(year,fullyNormalize,dataSet)
%%GETWMMCOEFFS Obtain spherical harmonic coefficients for the 2025 
%    version of the World Magnetic Model (WMM) or of the World Magnetic
%    Model High Resolution (WMMHR) at a particular time or at the reference
%    epoch (2025). The WMM and WMMHR predict the Earth's core field
%    forward in time from the reference epoch. Past field data, the
%    International geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is suggested. The WMM
%    model is valid for altitudes from 1km underground to 850km above
%    ground.
%
%INPUTS: year A decimal number indicating a year in the Gregorian calendar
%             as specified by universal coordinated time (UTC). For
%             example, halfway through the year 2021 would be represented
%             as 2021.5. The precision of the model is not sufficiently
%             fine that leap seconds matter. If this parameter is omitted,
%             then the reference year of 2025 is used. Years from 2025
%             onward should be used, because past years are often better
%             modeled using the IGRF.
% fullyNormalize Geomagnetic models are normally given in terms of Schmidt
%             semi-normalized Legendre functions with normalization term
%             N(n,m)=sqrt((2-KDelta(m))*factorial(n-m)/factorial(n+m))
%             If fullyNormalize =true, then the coefficients are converted
%             for use with fully normalized associated Legendre functions,
%             using the normalization as int he EGM2008 model, which is
%             N(n,m)=sqrt((2*n+1)*(2-KDelta(m))*factorial(n-m)/factorial(n+m))
%             If this parameter is omitted, the default value is true. The
%             function changeSpherHarmonicNorm can be used to change the
%             normalization afterwards.
%     dataSet This selects the dataset to load. Possibel values are:
%             0 Load the WMM.
%             1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Load
%               the WMMHR.
%
%OUTPUTS: C An array holding the coefficient terms that are multiplied by
%           cosines in the harmonic expansion. This can be given to a
%           CountingClusterSet class so that C(n+1,m+1) is the coefficient
%           of degree n and order m. The coefficients have units of Tesla.
%           The coefficients are normalized according to the fullyNormalize
%           input.
%         S An array holding the coefficient terms that are multiplied by
%           sines in the harmonic expansion. The format of S is the same as
%           that of C.
%         a The numerator in the (a/r)^n term in the spherical harmonic sum
%           having units of meters.
%         c The constant value by which the spherical harmonic series is
%           multiplied, having units of squared meters.
%
%Details on the normalization of the coefficients is given in the comments
%to the function spherHarmonicEval.
%
%Documentation for the WMM is given in [1] and information on Schmidt semi-
%normalized Legendre functions is given in [2].The coefficients are
%distributed at:
%https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/
%and 
%https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/world-magnetic-model-high-resolution
%where it is ntoed that theNGA recommends using the WMMHR in DoD systems
%instead of the WMM.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This shows how to get the magnetic field in the North-East-Down coordinate
%system that is used in [1].

function jobsSelected=scheduleIntervals(intervals)
%%SCHEDULEINTERVALS Given a set of jobs having fixed time intervals in
%           which one would like to execute them, determine the maximum
%           subset of jobs that are mutually compatible (that do not
%           overlap in time).
%
%INPUTS: intervals A 2XnumIntervals matrix of intervals such that
%                  intervals(:,i) is the ith interval where
%                  intervals(1,i)<=intervals(2,i).
%
%OUTPUTS: jobsSelected A numSelectedX1 set of the intervals that form the
%                  maximum subset of jobs to be executed that do not
%                  overlap. If intervals is an empty matrix, then
%                  jobsSelected is an empty matrix.
%
%A simple greedy algorithm is optimal. The algorithm is described in
%Chapter 4.1 of [1].  
%
%EXAMPLE:
% intervals=[0,1,3,3,4,5,6,8;
%            6,4,5,8,7,9,10,11];
% jobsSelected=scheduleIntervals(intervals);
%The maximum subset of jobs that can be scheduled is jobsSelected=[2;5;8].

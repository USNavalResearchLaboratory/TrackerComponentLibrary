function partition4Interval=partitionIntervals(intervals)
%%PARTITIONINTERVALS Given a set of possible overlkapping intervals, find a
%               way of arranging them into a minimum number of slots such
%               that no two intervals overlap. This could be used, for
%               example, to schedules classes into rooms when professors
%               set the times of the classes (assuming all rooms are large
%               enough).
%
%INPUTS: intervals A 2XnumIntervals matrix of intervals such that
%                  intervals(:,i) is the ith interval where
%                  intervals(1,i)<=intervals(2,i).
%
%OUTPUTS: partition4Interval A numIntervalsX1 vector where partitions(i)
%                  gives the integer partition to which the ith interval
%                  belongs.If intervals is an empty matrix, then
%                  partition4Interval will be an empty matrix too.
%
%The algorithm is a simple greedy algorithm as described in Chapter 4.1 of
%[1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
% intervals=[9,   9,   9,    11,  11, 13,  13,  14,  15,  15;
%            10.5,12.5,10.5, 12.5,14, 14.5,14.5,16.5,16.5,16.5];
% partition4Interval=partitionIntervals(intervals)
%The optimal set of partitions is partition4Interval=[1;2;3;1;3;1;2;3;1;2].

function [weightVal,jobsSelected]=scheduleWeightedIntervals(intervals,weights)
%%SCHEDULEWEIGHTEDINTERVALS Given a set of jobs having fixed time intervals
%                   in which one would like to execute them as well as
%                   positive weights associated with each job, determine
%                   the subset of jobs that are mutually compatible (that
%                   do not overlap in time) that maximize the total weight.
%
%INPUTS: intervals A 2XnumIntervals matrix of intervals such that
%                  intervals(:,i) is the ith interval where
%                  intervals(1,i)<=intervals(2,i).
%          weights A numIntervalsX1 or 1XnumIntervals vector of the weights
%                  associated with the intervals. Note that all entries of
%                  weights must be >=0 and finite.
%
%OUTPUTS: weightVal The scalar total weight of the subset of jobs having
%                   maximum weight.
%      jobsSelected A numSelectedX1 set of the intervals that form the
%                   maximum weight subset of jobs to be executed that do
%                   note overlap. If intervals is an empty matrix, then
%                   jobsSelected is an empty matrix.
%
%The algorithm to solve the problem is based on dynamic programming and is
%described in Chapters 6.1 and 6.2 of [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
% intervals=[1,3,0,4,3,5,6,8;
%            4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11];
% weights=[1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8];
% [weightVal,jobsSelected]=scheduleWeightedIntervals(intervals,weights)
%The optimal weight value is 13 and the optimal assignment of jobs is
%jobsSelected=[8;4;1]. That is actually the same as the maximum subset of
%jobs obtained using scheduleIntervals without considering the weights.
%However,the weights matter. For example in 
% intervals=[1,3,0,4,3,5,6,8;
%            4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11];
% weights=[1;2e8;3;4;5;6;7;8];
% [weightVal,jobsSelected]=scheduleWeightedIntervals(intervals,weights)
%The high weight of the second job forces it to be in any optimal
%assignment. Thus, jobsSelected=[8;2];
%
%Also, one might want to check that the algorithm works when the intervals
%are not sorted in order of increasing finishing time. Thus, 
% intervals=[3,8, 1,3,6, 5,0,4;
%            5,11,4,8,10,9,6,7];
% weights=[2;8;1;5;7;6;3;4];
% [weightVal,jobsSelected]=scheduleWeightedIntervals(intervals,weights)
%Here, one again gets a weight value of 13, but the jobsSelected=[2;8;3].
%These are the same intervals selected in the  first example.

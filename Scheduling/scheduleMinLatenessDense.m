function [jobs,tStarts]=scheduleMinLatenessDense(deadlines,durations,tStart)
%%SCHEDULEMINLATENESSDENSE Given an ordered list of scalar deadlines for
%                   certain tasks and an ordered list of durations of those
%                   tasks, create a schedule of when to execute the tasks
%                   so as to minimize the lateness of the tasks. Tasks are
%                   scheduled densely (no space between them).
%
%INPUTS: deadlines A numJobsX1 or 1XnumJobs array of deadline when each job
%                  must be completed. These could be, for example, seconds
%                  after some epoch.
%        durations A numJobsX1 or 1XnumJobs array of how long it takes to
%                  complete each job.
%           tStart An optional parameter indicating the scalar time when
%                  scheduling the jobs can commence. If this parameter is
%                  omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then tStart=0 is
%                  used.
%
%OUTPUTS: jobs A numJobsX1 list indicating the order in which the jobs
%              should be executed. If deadlines is empty, then an empty
%              matrix is returned.
%      tStarts A numJobsX1 list of when each job should begin being
%              executed. If deadlines is empty, then an empty matrix is
%              returned.
%
%The algorithm is a very simple greedy algorithm described in Chapter 4.3
%of [1]. The optimal order is just obtained by sorting the deadlines.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% deadlines=[14;6;8;9;9;15];
% durations =[3;3;2;1;4;2];
% tStart=0;
% [jobs,tStarts]=scheduleMinLatenessDense(deadlines,durations,tStart)
%The optimal ordering of jobs is [2;3;4;5;1;6]; and the corresponding start
%times are [0;3;5;6;10;13].

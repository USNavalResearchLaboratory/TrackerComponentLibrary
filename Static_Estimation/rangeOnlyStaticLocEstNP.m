function [xEst,PTaylor,PCRLB]=rangeOnlyStaticLocEstNP(rBi,zLoc1,zLoc2,method,RCov)
%%RANGEONLYSTATICLOCESTNP Given multiple bistatic range-only
%          measurements consisting of one receiver and multiple
%          transmitters (or vice versa), find the location of a target in
%          3D. The transmitter and receivers cannot all be coplanar.
%          Covariance matrices for the estimate are also available. With
%          noisy measurements, bad results are likely if the transmitters/
%          receivers are nearly coplanar, with scale related to the range
%          measurement accuracy.
%
%INPUTS: rBi A numMeasX1 vector of bistatic range measurements where
%            numMeas>=3 to ensure observability in 3D.
%      zLoc1 A 3XnumMeas vector of transmitter location vectors, if one
%            receiver and multiple transmitters are used. If one
%            transmitter and multiple receivers are used, then zLoc1
%            should be a 3XnumMeas vector of receiver locations.
%      zLoc2 A 3X1 vector of the receiver location, if multiple
%            transmitters are used, or a 3X1 vector of the transmitter
%            location if multiple receivers are used. No receiver can
%            be collocated with the transmitter because of how the problem
%            has been formulated.
%     method This selects the algorithm to use. Possible values are
%            0 Use the spherical-interpolation method of [1]. This will not
%              work if numMeas==3.
%            1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed). Use
%              the spherical intersection technique of [1].
%       RCov If a covariance matrix for the estimate is desired on the
%            output, then RCov, a measurement covariance matrix must be
%            provided. Otherwise, RCov can be omitted as the algorithm
%            implicitly assumes that all of the measurements have the same
%            accuracy.
%
%OUTPUTS: xEst The Cartesian target location estimate. If only the minimum
%              number of receivers/ transmitters is provided (3), then
%              there are two columns, each corresponding to one of the two
%              solutions.
%      PTaylor A covariance matrix for the estimate based on a Taylor
%              series expansion. then this is a 3D matrix, with the extra
%              dimension selecting the solution for which the covariance
%              matrix is valid.
%        PCRLB A covariance matrix (or matrices for two solutions) for the
%              estimates based on the Cramer-Rao lower bound.
%
%The target localization algorithm is based on the spherical intersection
%method of [1], where the Taylor series expansion covariance matrix for the
%estimate is also derived. The PCRLB covariance estimate is standard
%assuming additive Gaussian noise.

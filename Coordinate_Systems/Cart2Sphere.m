function points=Cart2Sphere(cartPoints,systemType,useHalfRange,zTx,zRx,M)
%%CART2SPHERE Convert Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates.
%             An option allows for the angles to be specified from
%             different axes. Optionally, a bistatic range can be used when
%             considering bistatic measurements in a local spherical
%             coordinate system.
%
%INPUTS: cartPoints A matrix of the points in Cartesian coordinates that
%           are to be transformed into spherical coordinates. Each column
%           of cartPoints is of the format [x;y;z]. Extra rows will be
%           ignored.
% systemType An optional parameter specifying the axes from which the
%           angles are measured in radians. Possible values are
%           0 (The default if omitted) Azimuth is measured
%             counterclockwise from the x-axis in the x-y plane. Elevation
%             is measured up from the x-y plane (towards the z-axis). This
%             is consistent with common spherical coordinate systems for
%             specifying longitude (azimuth) and geocentric latitude
%             (elevation).
%           1 Azimuth is measured counterclockwise from the z-axis in the
%             z-x plane. Elevation is measured up from the z-x plane
%             (towards the y-axis). This is consistent with some spherical
%             coordinate systems that use the z axis as the boresight
%             direction of the radar.
%           2 This is the same as 0 except instead of being given
%             elevation, one desires the angle away from the z-axis, which
%             is (pi/2-elevation).
%           3 This is the same as 0 except azimuth is measured clockwise
%             from the y-axis in the x-y plane instead of counterclockwise
%             from the x-axis. This coordinate system often arises when
%             given "bearings" in a local East-North-Up coordinate system,
%             where the bearing directions are measured East of North.
% useHalfRange An optional boolean value specifying whether the bistatic
%           (round-trip) range value has been divided by two. This normally
%           comes up when operating in monostatic mode (the most common
%           type of spherical coordinate system), so that the range
%           reported is a one-way range (or just half a bistatic range).
%           The default if this parameter is not provided is false if zTx
%           is provided and true if it is omitted (monostatic).
%       zTx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the transmitters in global
%           Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter is omitted, then the
%           transmitters are assumed to be at the origin. If only a single
%           vector is passed, then the transmitter location is assumed the
%           same for all of the target states being converted. zTx can have
%           more than 3 rows; additional rows are ignored.
%       zRx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the receiver in Cartesian
%           coordinates.  If this parameter is omitted, then the
%           receivers are assumed to be at the origin. If only a single
%           vector is passed, then the receiver location is assumed the
%           same for all of the target states being converted. zRx can have
%           more than 3 rows; additional rows are ignored.
%         M A 3X3XN hypermatrix of the rotation matrices to go from the
%           alignment of the global coordinate system to that at the
%           receiver. If omitted, then it is assumed that the local
%           coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(3) --the
%           identity matrix is used. If only a single 3X3 matrix is passed,
%           then it is assumed to be the same for all of the N conversions.
%
%OUTPUTS: points A matrix of the converted points. Each column of the
%                matrix has the format [r;azimuth;elevation], with azimuth
%                and elevation given in radians.
%
%The conversion from Cartesian to spherical coordinates is given in Chapter
%14.4.4.2 of [1]. Modifications have been made to deal with local, bistatic
%conversions.

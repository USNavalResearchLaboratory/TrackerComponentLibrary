function z=state2PolRR(xTar,systemType,useHalfRange,zTx,zRx,M,stateType)
%%STATE2POLRR Convert a 2D target state consisting of at least position
%             and velocity components into monostatic, one-way polar range
%             and angle and (if velocity components are provided) range
%             rate. The velocity components can either be a 2D Cartesian
%             vector or a heading angle in radians and a speed. The angles
%             can be measured either counterclockwise from the x-axis,
%             which is standard in mathematics, or clockwise from the
%             y-axis, which is more common in navigation.
%
%INPUTS: xTar A xDimXN matrix of N target states consisting of 2D
%          position and, if a range rate measurement is desired, velocity
%          components in the order xTar=[xPosition;xVelocity], if
%          stateType=0, or in the format [xPosition;headingAngle;speed] is
%          stateType=1. If stateType=-1, only position components need to
%          be provided and range rate is not returned. Other components in
%          the state are ignored.
% systemType An optional parameter specifying the axes from which the
%          angles are measured. Possible values are
%          0 (The default if omitted) The azimuth angle is counterclockwise
%            from the x axis.
%          1 The azimuth angle is measured clockwise from the y axis.
% useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
%          should be divided by two. This normally comes up when operating
%          in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is a one-way
%          range. The default if this parameter is not provided (or an
%          empty matrix is provided) is true.
%      zTx The 4XN [x;y;xDot;yDot] position and velocity vectors of the
%          transmitters in global Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter
%          is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then the transmitters
%          are assumed to be at the origin. If only a single vector is
%          passed, then the transmitter location is assumed the same for
%          all of the target states being converted.
%      zRx The 4XN [x;y;xDot;yDot] position and velocity vectors of the
%          receivers in Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter is omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed, then the receivers are assumed to
%          be at the origin. If only a single vector is passed, then the
%          receiver location is assumed the same for all of the target
%          states being converted.
%        M A 2X2 rotation matrix to go from the alignment of the global
%          coordinate system to that at the receiver. If omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed, then it is assumed that the local
%          coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(2) --the
%          identity matrix is used.
%   stateType An optional parameter specifying the format of the target
%          state. Possible values are
%          -1 The target state consists of 2D Cartesian position and no
%             range rate estimate will be returned. Other target state
%             components are ignored.
%           0 (The default if omitted) The target state is given in terms
%             of 2D position, and 2D Cartesian velocity. Other components
%             are ignored.
%           1 The target state is given in terms of 2D position, a
%             heading angle (in radians) and a speed. The heading angle
%             is measured in the same system as the measurement, given by
%             the next parameter. Other state components are ignored.
%
%OUTPUTS: z If stateType!=-1, z is a 3XN matrix of the target states in xTar
%          converted into 2D polar coordinates consisting of range,
%          azimuthal angle, and range rate. Otherwise, if stateType==-1,
%          then z is a 2XN matrix of the position components of the target
%          state converted into 2D polar coordinates.

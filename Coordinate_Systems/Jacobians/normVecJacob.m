function J=normVecJacob(x)
%%NORVECJACOB Consider a unit vector created as u=x/norm(x). This function
%         returns the partial derivatives of u with respect to the elements
%         of x. In other words, this is the gradient of a unit vector.
%
%INPUTS: x A real NX1 vector.
%
%OUTPUTS: J The NXN partial derivative matrix The columns are the element
%           of x with respect to which the partial derivative is taken and
%           the rows are the elements of u.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we verify that the output of this function agrees with the numerical
%differentiation result.
% x=[4;-18;12];
% u=@(x)x/norm(x);
% JNumDiff=numDiff(x,u,3);
% J=normVecJacob(x);
% RelErr=max(abs((J(:)-JNumDiff(:))./J(:)))
%The relative error will be about 3.8488e-10, indicating a good level of
%agreement between the numerical differentiation result and the analytic
%result.

function J=calcRuvJacob(x,useHalfRange,lTx,lRx,M,includeW)
%%CALCRUVJACOB Calculate the Jacobian for a monostatic or bistatic r-u-v
%           measurement with respect to 3D Cartesian position. Atmospheric
%           effects are ignored.
%
%INPUTS: x The 3X1 position of the target in Cartesian coordinates in the
%          order [x;y;z].
% useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
%          has been divided by two. This normally comes up when operating
%          in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is a one-way
%          range. The default if this parameter is not provided is false.
%      lTx The 3X1 transmitter position in the global coordinate system
%          with [x;y;z] components. If omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then a vector of zeros is used.
%      lRx The 3X1 receiver position in the global coordinate system
%          with [x;y;z] components. If omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then a vector of zeros is used.
%        M A 3X3 rotation matrix from the global Coordinate system to the
%          orientation of the coordinate system at the receiver. This is
%          only necessary if u-v direction components are desired. If
%          omitted, it is assumed to be the identity matrix.
% includeW An optional boolean value indicating whether a third direction
%          cosine component should be included. The u and v direction
%          cosines are two parts of a 3D unit vector. Generally, one might
%          assume that the target is in front of the sensor, so the third
%          component would be positive and is not needed. However, the
%          third component can be included if ambiguity exists. The default
%          if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is
%          false.
%
%OUTPUTS: J The 3X3 Jacobian matrix with derivatives with respect to
%           position components. Each row is a component of bistatic range,
%           u and v in that order with derivatives taken with respect to
%           [x,y,z] across columns.
%
%This function just calls rangeGradient and uvGradient.

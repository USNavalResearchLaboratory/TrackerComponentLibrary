function J=calcPolarRRConvJacob(zPolarRR,systemType,useHalfRange,lTx,lRx,M)
%%CALCPOLARRRCONVJACOB Calculate the Jacobian for a bistatic range and
%            polar angle measurement in 2D with a monostatic or bistatic
%            range rate, ignoring atmospheric effects with respect to
%            Cartesian position augmented with the range rate component.
%            This type of Jacobian is useful when performing tracking using
%            Cartesian-converted measurements where the clutter density is
%            specified in the measurement coordinate system, not the
%            converted measurement coordinate system. In this instance, the
%            position measurement would have been converted to Cartesian,
%            but the range rate cannot, because it does not specify a full
%            velocity vector.
%
%INPUTS: zPolarRR A 3X1 point in polar coordinates in the format
%          [range;azimuth;rangeRate], where the angle is given in radians
%          and the range/range rate can be bistatic. It is also possible to
%          pass a 2X1 point of just [range;azimuth], because the Jacobian
%          does not depend on the range-rate value.
% systemType An optional parameter specifying the axis from which the
%          azimuth angle is measured. It is assumed that the azimuth
%          angle is given in radians. Possible values are
%          0 (The default if omitted) The azimuth angle is
%             counterclockwise from the x axis.
%          1 The azimuth angle is measured clockwise from the y axis.
% useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
%          should be divided by two. This normally comes up
%          when operating in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is
%          a one-way range. The default if this parameter is not provided
%          is false.
%      lTx The 2X1 [x;y] location vector of the transmitter in Cartesian
%          coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then the transmitter is assumed to be at the origin.
%      lRx The 2X1 [x;y] location vector of the receiver in Cartesian
%          coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then the receiver is assumed to be at the origin.
%        M A 2X2 rotation matrices to go from the alignment of the global
%          coordinate system to that at the receiver. If omitted or an
%          empty matrix is passed, then it is assumed that the local
%          coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(2,2)
%          --the identity matrix is used. 
%
%OUTPUTS: J The 3X3 Jacobian matrix. Each row is a components of range,
%           azimuth, and range rate (in that order by row) with
%           derivatives taken with respect to [x,y, range rate] by column.
%
%This function calls the calcPolarConvJacob function and augments the
%returned matrix with a 1 for the range-rate-range-rate derivative.

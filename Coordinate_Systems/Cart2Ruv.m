function z=Cart2Ruv(zC,useHalfRange,zTx,zRx,M,includeW)
%CART2RUV Convert points in Cartesian coordinates (either the global
%         system or a local system at the receiver) into local bistatic
%         r-u-v coordinates of the receiver. r-u-v coordinates consist of a
%         bistatic range and direction cosines at the receiver. The
%         "direction cosines" u and v are just the x and y coordinates of a
%         unit vector from the receiver to the target in the coordinate
%         system at the receiver. This basically assumes that the boresight
%         direction of the receiver is the z axis. Assuming the target is
%         in front of the receiver, the third unit vector coordinate is not
%         needed. However, with the includeW option, it can be provided,
%         resulting in r-u-v-w coordinates.
%
%INPUT: zC A 3XN matrix of Cartesian points in global [x;y;z] Cartesian
%          coordinates. Extra rows are ignored.
% useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
%          should be divided by two. This normally comes up when operating
%          in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is a one-way
%          range. The default if this parameter is not provided (or an
%          empty matrix is provided) is false.
%      zTx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the transmitters in global
%          Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%          matrix is passed, then the transmitters are assumed to be at the
%          origin. If only a single vector is passed, then the transmitter
%          location is assumed the same for all of the points being
%          converted. zTx can have more than 3 rows; additional rows are
%          ignored.
%      zRx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the receivers in Cartesian
%          coordinates.  If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix
%          is passed, then the receivers are assumed to be at the origin.
%          If only a single vector is passed, then the receiver location
%          is assumed the same for all of the points being converted. zRx
%          can have more than 3 rows; additional rows are ignored.
%        M A 3X3XN hypermatrix of the rotation matrices to go from the
%          alignment of the global coordinate system to that at the
%          receiver. The z-axis of the local coordinate system of the
%          receiver is the pointing direction of the receiver. If omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed, then it is assumed that the local
%          coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(3) --the
%          identity matrix is used. If only a single 3X3 matrix is passed,
%          then it is assumed to be the same for all of the N conversions.
% includeW An optional boolean value indicating whether a third direction
%          cosine component should be included. The u and v direction
%          cosines are two parts of a 3D unit vector. Generally, one might
%          assume that the target is in front of the sensor, so the third
%          component would be positive and is not needed. However, the
%          third component can be included if ambiguity exists. The default
%          if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is
%          false.
%
%OUTPUT: z The 3XN (or 4XN if includeW is true) matrix of location vectors
%          of the points in bistatic [r;u;v] coordinates. If
%          useHalfRange=true, then the r component is half the bistatic
%          range (half the round-trip range for a monostatic scenario).
% 
%Details of the conversion are given in [1].

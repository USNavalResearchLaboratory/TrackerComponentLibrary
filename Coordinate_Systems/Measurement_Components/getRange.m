%%GETRANGE Obtain the bistatic range measurements of targets in the absence
%          of refraction under non-relativistic mechanics, ignoring
%          atmospheric effects.
%
%INPUTS: xCart The numDimXN set of N target positions. numDim is typically
%              2 or 3.
% useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
%             should be divided by two. This normally comes up when
%             operating in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is
%             a one-way range. The default if this parameter is not
%             provided is false.
%         zTx A numDimXN matrix of the positions of the transmitters . If
%             this parameter is omitted, the transmitters are assumed to be
%             at the origin. If only a single vector is passed, then the
%             transmitter position is assumed the same for all of the
%             target states being converted.
%         zRx A numDimXN matrix of the positions of the receivers. If this
%             parameter is omitted, the receivers are assumed to be at the
%             origin. If only a single vector is passed, then the receiver
%             position is assumed the same for all of the target states
%             being converted.
%
%OUTPUTS: r The 1XN bistatic ranges of the targets.
%
%Bistatic range is discussed in [1].

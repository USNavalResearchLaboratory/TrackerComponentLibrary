function z=getUDirection3D(zC,zRx,M)
%%GETUDIRECTION3D Convert a position into a single local direction cosines
%         u. Direction cosines u and v are just the x and y coordinates of
%         a unit vector from the receiver to the target in the coordinate
%         system at the receiver. This assumes that the boresight direction
%         of the receiver is the local z axis.
%
%INPUTS: zC A 3XN matrix of Cartesian points in global [x;y;z] Cartesian
%          coordinates.
%      zRx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the receiver in Cartesian
%          coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then the receiver is assumed to be at the origin.
%        M A 3X3 rotation matrix to go from the alignment of the global
%          coordinate system to that at the receiver. The z-axis of the
%          local coordinate system of the receiver is the pointing
%          direction of the receiver. If omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then it is assumed that the local coordinate system is
%          aligned with the global and M=eye(3) --the identity matrix is
%          used.
%
%OUTPUTS: z The 1XN vector of the u direction cosines for the points in zC.
%
%Details of the conversion are given in [1].

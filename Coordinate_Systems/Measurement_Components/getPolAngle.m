function theta=getPolAngle(zC,systemType,zRx,M)
%%GETPOLANGLE Convert positions in 2D into local polar angles in radians.
%
%INPUTS: z A 2XN matrix of Cartesian points whoe polar angles are desired.
%          Each column of cartPoints is of the format [x;y].
% systemType An optional parameter specifying the axes from which the
%          angles are measured. Possible values are
%          0 (The default if omitted) The azimuth angle is counterclockwise
%            from the x axis.
%          1 The azimuth angle is measured clockwise from the y axis.
%      zRx The 2XN [x;y] location vectors of the receivers in Cartesian
%          coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then the receivers are assumed to be at the origin. If
%          only a single vector is passed, then the receiver location is
%          assumed the same for all of the target states being converted.
%        M A 2X2XN hypermatrix of the rotation matrices to go from the
%          alignment of the global coordinate system to that at the
%          receiver. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then it is
%          assumed that the local coordinate system is aligned with the
%          global and M=eye(2) --the identity matrix is used. If only a
%          single 2X2 matrix is passed, then it is assumed to be the same
%          for all of the N conversions.
%
%OUTPUT: theta The 1XN matrix of azimuth angles in radians
%
%The conversion a shifted rotated coordinate system in 2D is similar to
%that using bistatic r-u-v measurements in 3D, which is discussed in [1].

function azEl=getSpherAngle(zC,systemType,zRx,M)
%%GETSPHERANGLE Convert a position into local spherical angles
%         [azimuth;elevation] in radians ignoring atmospheric and other
%         propagation effects.
%
%INPUT: zC A 3XN matrix of Cartesian points in global [x;y;z] Cartesian
%          coordinates.
% systemType An optional parameter specifying the axes from which the
%          angles are measured in radians. Possible values are
%          0 (The default if omitted) Azimuth is measured
%            counterclockwise from the x-axis in the x-y plane. Elevation
%            is measured up from the x-y plane (towards the z-axis). This
%            is consistent with common spherical coordinate systems for
%            specifying longitude (azimuth) and geocentric latitude
%            (elevation).
%          1 Azimuth is measured counterclockwise from the z-axis in the
%            z-x plane. Elevation is measured up from the z-x plane
%            (towards the y-axis). This is consistent with some spherical
%            coordinate systems that use the z axis as the boresight
%            direction of the radar.
%          2 This is the same as 0 except instead of being given
%            elevation, one desires the angle away from the z-axis, which
%            is (pi/2-elevation).
%          3 This is the same as 0 except azimuth is measured clockwise
%            from the y-axis in the x-y plane instead of counterclockwise
%            from the x-axis. This coordinate system often arises when
%            given "bearings" in a local East-North-Up coordinate system,
%            where the bearing directions are measured East of North.
%      zRx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the receivers in Cartesian
%          coordinates.  If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed, then the receivers are assumed to be at the origin. If
%          only a single vector is passed, then the receiver location is
%          assumed the same for all of the target states being converted.
%        M A 3X3XN hypermatrix of the rotation matrices to go from the
%          alignment of the global coordinate system to that at the
%          receiver. The z-axis of the local coordinate system of the
%          receiver is the pointing direction of the receiver. If omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed, then it is assumed that the local
%          coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(3) --the
%          identity matrix is used. If only a single 3X3 matrix is passed,
%          then is=t is assumed to be the same for all N conversions.
%
%OUTPUT: azEl The 2XN matrix of azimuth and elevation angles in radians in
%             the form [azimuth;elevation].
%
%The conversion from Cartesian to spherical coordinates is given in Chapter
%14.4.4.2 of [1].

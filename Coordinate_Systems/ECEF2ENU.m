function [xENU,M]=ECEF2ENU(plhOrigin,xECEF,a,f)
%%ECEF2ENU Convert from an Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) Cartesian
%          coordinate system to a local East-North-Up (ENU) coordinate
%          system. The alignment of the coordinate axes with the reference
%          ellipsoid is the one used in common standards such as that used
%          by the DoD's WGS-84 standard and the International Earth
%          Rotation and Reference Systems Service's (IERS) international
%          terrestrial reference frame (ITRF). The global ECEF z-axis is
%          North.
%
%INPUTS: plhOrigin A 3X1 point in [latitude;longitude; ellipsoidal height]
%             coordinates with respect to a reference ellipsoid
%             parameterized by a and f, derving as the origin of the local
%             ENU coordinate system. Latitude and longitude are given in
%             radians North and East.
%       xECEF A 3XnumPts collection of 3D Cartesian points in an ECEF
%             coordinate system that should be converted to a local ENU
%             coordinate system.
%           a The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If this
%             argument is omitted, the value in
%             Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If this
%             argument is omitted, the value in Constants.WGS84Flattening
%             is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: xENU A 3XnumPts matrix of the points in xECEF converted to ENU
%              coordinates.
%            M A rotation matrix such that rotates a point from ECEF to ENU
%              coordinates.
%
%The ENU coordinate system is a common local tangent plane cooridnate
%system. Here, we take "up" to be that described by a reference ellipsoid
%and not true gravitational "up". This limits the accuracy of the local
%coordinate system.
%
%The conversions are mentioned in [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%In this example, we convert a point from the local ENU coordinate system
%to ECEF and then back to the local ENU cordinate system. The relative
%error of the converted-back point is considered.
% lat=19.7241*(pi/180);
% lon=-155.0868*(pi/180);
% height=0;
% plhPoint=[lat;lon;height];%Around Hilo, Hawaii.
% 
% xENU=[100;200;300];
% RelErr=abs(ECEF2ENU(plhPoint,ENU2ECEF(plhPoint,xENU))-xENU)./xENU
%One will find the relative error to be under 1e-11, which is on the order
%of finite-precision limits.

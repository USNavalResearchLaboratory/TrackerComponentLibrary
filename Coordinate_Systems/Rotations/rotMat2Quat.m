function q=rotMat2Quat(R,handed)
%%ROTMAT2QUAT Get a unit quaternion corresponding to a particular rotation
%             matrix. The quaternion can be chosen to support standard
%             right-handed quaternion multiplication rules, or non-standard
%             left-handed rules that some authors choose to use.
%
%INPUTS:  M A 3X3 orthonormal real rotation matrix.
%    handed The handedness of the quaternion. If omitted, it is assumed
%           that the quaternion is right-handed (the standard). Possible
%           values are:
%           'right' The default if omitted. The quaternion multiplication
%                   is assumed right-handed (standard).
%           'left'  The quaternion multiplication is assumed left-handed.
%                   This is used in someplaces, including the reference
%                   from Shuster, below.
%
%OUTPUTS: q A 4X1 unit quaternion corresponding to the rotation matrix. The
%           quaternion is ordered [cos(theta/2);sin(theta/2)u'] where u is
%           a unit vector for the axis of rotation and theta is the
%           counterclockwise (right-handed) or clockwise (left-handed)
%           rotation angle about that unit vector.
%
%The formulae for converting a rotation matrix are from [1], where a minor
%change has been performed to support both right and left-handed
%quaternions. Both q and -q represent the same rotations. Here, the
%solution is chosen so that when considering a left-handed rotation, the
%sign of the largest magnitude element is positive. When considering a
%right handed rotation, the sign of the largest element may or may not be
%positive. Also, to help mitigate finite precision limitations, the
%quaternion, which should have unit magnitude if the input matrix is truly
%a rotation matrix, is normalized.
%
%A quaternion of form q(1)+i*q(2)+j*q(3)+k*q(4) that obeys right-handed
%multiplication rules supports the following rules for multiplication of i,
%j, and k, where an item in a row is multiplied by an item in the column to
%get the result:
%  i,  j, k
%i -1, k,-j
%j -k,-1, i
%k  j,-i,-1
%On the other hand, left-handed multiplication rules flip the signs of the
%off-diagonal terms:
%  i,  j, k
%i -1,-k, j
%j  k,-1,-i
%k -j, i,-1

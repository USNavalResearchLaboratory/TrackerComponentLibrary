function boolVal=pointIsInAzBeam(points,azBounds,boundType)
%%POINTISINAZBEAM A region in angles is defined either in
%      terms of a central angle and a beamwidth (the width being the
%      distance between the angular bounds of the region) or in terms of a
%      starting angle and an ending angle, determine whether provided
%      points are within that angular span. Because of the circular nature
%      of angles, one cannot simply compare the values in the points to
%      those of the bounds. 
%
%INPUTS: points A vector or matrix of angular values in radians to test
%               whether or not they are in the beam.
%      azBounds A 2X1 vector defining the bounds of the beam. If
%               boundType=0, then azBounds(1) is the direction of the
%               center of the beam in radians and azBounds(2) is the half
%               beamwidth of the beam. If boundType=1, then azBounds(1) is
%               the lower angular bound and azBounds(2) is the upper
%               angular bound --where the angles are taken in increasing
%               (aliased) order. Thus, if azBounds(1) is 0 and azBounds(2)
%               is -pi/2, then the beam occupies 3/4 of the circle.
%     boundType This is either 0 or 1 and affects the format of azBounds,
%               as described above. The default if omitted or an empty
%               matrix is passed is 0. 
%
%OUTPUTS: boolVal This has the same size as the input and the entries are
%                 true if the corresponding entry in the input is in the
%                 beam and false if it is not in the beam. 
%
%For the case where boundType is 0 and beamHalfwidth is pi, the function
%has a special test to take the entire circle as true. For the case where
%boundType is 1, if azBounds(2)-azBounds(1) is 2*pi, then again the entire
%circle is taken.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This takes all the angles on the unit circle and plots them. It also forms
%a beam and plots just the points in the beam. Points are determined to be
%in the beam or not using pointIsInAzBeam.
% beamCenter=deg2rad(130);
% beamHalfwidth=deg2rad(15);
% numPts=1000;
% points=linspace(-pi,pi,numPts);
% boolVals=pointIsInAzBeam(points,[beamCenter;beamHalfwidth]);
% 
% systemType=0;
% xyPts=pol2Cart(points,systemType);
% figure(1)
% clf
% hold on
% closeEnds=true;
% drawAzBeam(beamCenter,beamHalfwidth,1,systemType,[],[],closeEnds,'-k','linewidth',4);
% scatter(xyPts(1,:),xyPts(2,:),'.b')
% axis([-1.25,1.25,-1.25,1.25])
% %Only the points in the beam.
% xyPts=xyPts(:,boolVals);
% scatter(xyPts(1,:),xyPts(2,:),'.r')

function [zCam,isBehind]=uvCoords2CameraCoords(uv,A,M)
%%UVCOORDS2CAMERACOORDS Convert a set of u-v direction cosines (or a full 
%          3D unit vector) direction vector into a measurement in the local
%          coordinate system of a perspective camera (distances on a CCD).
%          The model used is described in [1] and in the comments to
%          the inverse to this function, which is cameraCoords2UVCoords.
%
%INPUTS: uv A 2XnumPts set of uv direction cosines or a 3XnumPts set of
%           unit direction vectors. If M is provided, and only a 2XnumPts
%           set of vectors is given, the missing third component is assumed
%           to be positive. If after rotation into the local coordinate
%           system, the third coordinate is negative (which is not allowed
%           for targets in front of the camera), it is invalid and is
%           marked as being behind the sensor in isBehind.
%         A A 3X3 matrix, as described in the comments to
%           cameraCoords2UVCoords. The third row must be
%           [0,0,1]
%         M A 3X3XN rotation matrix to go from the alignment of the
%           global coordinate system to that at the receiver. The z-axis of
%           the local coordinate system of the receiver is the pointing
%           direction of the receiver. If omitted or an empty matrix is
%           passed, then it is assumed that the local coordinate system is
%           aligned with the global and M=eye(3) --the identity matrix is
%           used. 
%
%OUTPUTS: zCam The 2XnumPts set of direction given as distances on the CCD
%              of a camera.
%     isBehind A 1XnumPts set of boolean values indicating whether each
%              direction provided is behind the receiver and thus is not
%              valid.
%
%See the function cameraCoords2UVCoords for more details on the model and
%for an example conversion.

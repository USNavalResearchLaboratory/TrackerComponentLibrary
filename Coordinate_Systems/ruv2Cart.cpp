/*RUV2CART Convert points in bistatic r-u-v (or r-u-v-w) coordinates into
*         Cartesian coordinates. If r-u-v coordinates are used, the target
*         is assumed to be in front of the receiver (local z coordinate is
*         positive). r-u-v coordinates consist of a bistatic range and
*         direction cosines at the receiver. The "direction cosines" u and
*         v are just the x and y coordinates of a unit vector from the
*         receiver to the target in the coordinate system at the receiver.
*         This basically assumes that the boresight direction of the
*         receiver is the z axis. Assuming the target is in front of the
*         receiver, the third unit vector coordinate is not needed.
*         However, r-u-v-w coordinates include the third component.
*         For monostatic coordinate conversion where the range is a one-way
*         range, set useHalfRange=true and zTx and zRx to the same value.
*
*INPUTS: z A 3XN matrix of vectors with elements [r;u;v], where r is the
*          bistatic range from the transmitter to the target to the
*          receiver, and u and v are direction cosines. Each u,v pair
*          should have a magnitude less than or equal to one. If the
*          magnitude is greater than one, then the pair is normalized
*          before conversion to avoid imaginary results. Alternatively, one
*          can pass a 4XN matrix of [r;u;v;w] vectors where [u;v;w] form a
*          full unit vector in the receiver's local 3D Cartesian
*          coordinates.
* useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic range value
*          should be divided by two. This normally comes up when operating
*          in monostatic mode, so that the range reported is a one-way
*          range. The default if this parameter is not provided, or an
*          empty matrix is passed, is false.
*      zTx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the transmitters in global
*          Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
*          matrix is passed, then the transmitters are assumed to be at the
*          origin. If only a single vector is passed, then the transmitter
*          location is assumed the same for all of the target states being
*          converted. zTx can have more than 3 rows; additional rows are
*          ignored.
*      zRx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the receivers in Cartesian
*          coordinates.  If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix
*          is passed, then the receivers are assumed to be at the origin.
*          If only a single vector is passed, then the receiver location
*          is assumed the same for all of the target states being
*          converted. zRx can have more than 3 rows; additional rows are
*          ignored.
*        M A 3X3XN hypermatrix of the rotation matrices to go from the
*          alignment of the global coordinate system to that at the
*          receiver. The z-axis of the local coordinate system of the
*          receiver is the pointing direction of the receiver. If omitted
*          or an empty matrix is passed, then it is assumed that the local
*          coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(3) --the
*          identity matrix is used. If only a single 3X3 matrix is passed,
*          then is is assumed to be the same for all of the N conversions.
*
*OUTPUTS: zC The 3XN matrix of the converted points in [x;y;z] Cartesian
*            coordinates.
*
*Basic u and v direction cosines do not specify which side of the radar the
*target is on. That is, they do not specify the sign of z. This
*performs the conversion assuming that z is positive in the local
*coordinate system of the receiver. Details of the conversion are given in
*[1].
*
* The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
* CompileCLibraries function.
*
*The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
*zC=ruv2Cart(z,useHalfRange,zTx,zRx,M)

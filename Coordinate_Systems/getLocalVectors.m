function vLocal=getLocalVectors(vGlobal,uList)
%%GETLOCALVECTORS Change a collection of global vectors into local
%                 vectors using the global coordinate axes. This multiplies
%                 the components of the vectors by the corresponding
%                 coordinate axis vectors. Given the global coordinate axes
%                 as orthonormal unit vectors, the inverse basis vectors
%                 are obtained as the transposes of each 3X3 matrix in
%                 uList.
%
%INPUTS: vGlobal A numDimsXN matrix of N global vectors that are to be
%                converted.              
%          uList A numDimsXnumDimsVXN matrix of orthonormal unit coordinate
%                axes that are associated with the local coordinate system
%                in which the vectors are expressed. If all N vectors use
%                the same local coordinate system, then a numDimsxnumDimsx1
%                matrix can be passed instead.
%
%OUTPUTS: vLocal The numDImsVXN vectors in the local coordinate system.

function [u,c]=getENUAxes(plhPoint,justVertical,a,f)
%%GETENUAXES Find the East-North-Up unit vectors at the given point as well
%            as the magnitudes of the derivatives of a position vector with
%            respect to latitude, longitude and height.
%
%INPUTS: plhPoint The point at which the axes are to be found given in
%                 terms of [latitude;longitude] (with an assumed
%                 ellipsoidal height of 0) or [latitude;longitude;height]
%                 with the geodetic latitude and longitude in radians and
%                 the height in meters. The latitude should be between
%                 -pi/2 and pi/2. The height does not change the unit
%                 direction vectors u but it does change c.
%    justVertical An optional parameter. If this is given and is true, then
%                 u and c only for the Up direction will be returned. The
%                 default is false. For the up direction, c is always 1.
%               a The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. This is
%                 only used if the c output is requested and
%                 justVertical=false. If this argument is omitted or an
%                 empty matrix is passed, the value in
%                 Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%               f The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. This is
%                 only used if the c output is requested and
%                 justVertical=false. If this argument is omitted, the
%                 value in Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: u u(:,1), u(:,2), and u(:,3) are respectively the East, North and
%           Up unit vectors.
%         c c(1), c(2), and c(3) are the respective magnitudes of the
%           derivative of the Cartesian position with respect to latitude,
%           longitude, and height.
%
%The local East-North-Up coordinate system is an orthonormal coordinate
%system given by the normalized derivatives of a Cartesian position vector
%taken with respect to longitude, geodetic, latitude and height. It is
%described in [1], where expressions for the ENU vectors are given.
%However, when just considering the vector directions and not the
%magnitudes, the dependence on a and f goes away, as given in Appendix C of
%[2].
%
%The longitude coordinate determines the orientation of the axes at the
%poles.
%
%If only the up vector is desired, include the second parameter set to
%true.

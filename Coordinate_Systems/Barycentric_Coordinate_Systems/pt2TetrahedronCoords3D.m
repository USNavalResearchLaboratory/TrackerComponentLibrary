function [phi,dphi]=pt2TetrahedronCoords3D(x,v)
%%PT2TETRAHEDRONCOORDS3D Convert a 3D point to barycentric coordinates in
%      a tetrahedron using the relative areas of subtetrahedra, as
%      discussed at the beginning of [1]. A signed tetrahedral volume area
%      is used so that points outside of the tetrahedron can also be
%      represented (albeit with some negative weights).
%
%INPUTS: x The 3XnumPts set of points to convert into tetrahedral
%          coordinates.
%        v The 3X4 set of vertices of the tetrahedron.
%
%OUTPUTS: phi A 4XnumPts set of the coordinates in the triangle.
%        dphi A 4X3XnumPts set of derivatives of the elements of phi
%             (rows) taken with respect to the elements of x (columns) for
%             each input measurement (3rd dimension).
%
%In [1], the coordinates are defined as the ratio of th volume of a number
%of sub-tetrahedra (with x as a vertex) and the tetrahedron given in v.
%Here, things differ a little bit in that signed tetrahedral volumes are
%using with a very specific ordering. This allows this function to work
%with points inside the tetrahedron (with all positive weights) as well as
%with points outside the tetrahdron (with some negative weights).
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%In this example, the coordinates of three points are found and the points
%are recreated from the phi values. The residual error of the reverse
%conversion is seen to be on the order of finite precision errors.
% x=sqrt(3)/3;
% h=sqrt(6)/3;
% d=sqrt(3)/6;
% v=[x,  -d,  -d, 0;
%    0, 1/2,-1/2, 0;
%    0,   0,   0, h];
% xPts=[[0;0;0.5],[x;0;0],[1;1;1]];
% phi=pt2TetrahedronCoords3D(xPts,v);
% xBack=barycentricCoords2Pt(phi,v);
% ResidualErr=max(max(abs(xBack-xPts)))
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%In this example, we verify that the derivative is consistent with
%numerical differentiation. The absolute error is consistent with what one
%might expect due to finite precision limitations.
% v=randn(3,4);
% x=randn(3,1);
% [~,dphi]=pt2TetrahedronCoords3D(x,v);
% f=@(y)pt2TetrahedronCoords3D(y,v);
% dPhiNumDiff=numDiff(x,f,4);
% RelErr=max(max(abs((dphi-dPhiNumDiff)./dPhiNumDiff)))

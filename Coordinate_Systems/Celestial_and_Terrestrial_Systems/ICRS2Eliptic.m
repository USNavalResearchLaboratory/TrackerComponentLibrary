function eclipVec=ICRS2Eliptic(vec,TT1,TT2,method) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%ICRS2ECLIPTIC Convert a location vector from the International
%               Celestial Reference System (ICRS) to eliptic coordinates
%               either using the IAU 2006 precession model or the Vondrak
%               400 millennia precession model.
%
%INPUTS: x The NXnumVec collection of vectors in the ICRS to convert. N
%          can be 2, or 3. If the vectors are 2D, then they are assumed to
%          be azimuth and elevation in radians. 3D vectors are assumed to
%          be Cartesian position.
% Jul1, Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in terrestrial time (TT).
%          The units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%          both terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
%          bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
%   method An optional parameter specifying which algorithm is to be used.
%          Possible values are
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use the
%            IAU 2006 precession model.
%          1 Use the long-term (Vondrak) precession model.
%
%OUTPUTS: xG The vectors rotated into the ecliptic coordinate system. If
%            the input was 2D azimuth and elevation, the output will be
%            the same. If the input was Cartesian, then the output will be
%            Cartesian.
%
%This function is a Matlab interface for the relevant functions in the
%International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental
%Astronomy library.
%
%The ecliptic is defined in the IERS Conventions [1] to be the "the
%plane perpendicular to the mean heliocentric orbital angular momentum
%vector of the Earth-Moon barycentre in the BCRS".
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%eclipVec=ICRS2Eliptic(vec,TT1,TT2,method);

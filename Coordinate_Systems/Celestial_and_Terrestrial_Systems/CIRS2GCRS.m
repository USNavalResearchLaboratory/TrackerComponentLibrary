function [vec,rotMat]=CIRS2GCRS(x,Jul1,Jul2,dXdY) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%CIRS2GCRS Convert vectors of position and possibly velocity from the
%           Celestial Intermediate Reference System (CIRS) to the 
%           Geocentric Celestrial Reference System (GCRS), a type of
%           Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate system. The velocity
%           conversion omits the centrifugal effects of the CIP motion,
%           which have a period on the order of 14 months and are thus
%           small.
%
%INPUTS: x The NXnumVec collection of vectors to convert. N can be 3, or
%          6. If the vectors are 3D, then they can be either position or
%          velocity. 6D vectors are assumed to be position and velocity.
% Jul1, Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in terrestrial time (TT).
%          The units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%          terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more bits
%          of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
%     dXdY dXdY=[dX;dY] are the celestial pole offsets with respect to
%          the IAU 2006/2000A precession/nutation model in radians If this
%          parameter is omitted, the value from the function getEOP will
%          be used.
%
%OUTPUTS: vec A 3XN or 6XN matrix of vectors converted from CIRS
%             coordinates to GCRS coordinates.
%      rotMat The 3X3 rotation matrix used for the rotation of the
%             positions and velocities.
%
%The conversion functions from the International Astronomical Union's
%(IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library are put together to get
%the necessary rotation matrix for the position.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[vec,rotMat]=CIRS2GCRS(x,Jul1,Jul2);
%or if more parameters are known,
%[vec,rotMat]=CIRS2GCRS(x,Jul1,Jul2,dXdY);
%
%Different celestial coordinate systems are compared in [1].

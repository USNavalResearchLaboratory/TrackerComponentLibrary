function retVec=J2000F2ICRS(vec,TT1,TT2) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%J2000F2ICRS Convert vectors from the J2000.0 dynamical frame to the
%            International Celestial Reference System (ICRS). This
%            involves applying a frame bias rotation.
%
%INPUTS: vec The 3XN matrix of N vectors that are to be rotated from the
%            J2000.0 dynamical frame into the ICRS.
%   TT1, TT2 Two parts of a Julian date given in terrestrial time (TT).
%            The units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%            both terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
%            bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
%
%OUTPUTS: retVec The 3XN set of vectors rotated into the ICRS.
%
%As described in [1], the ICRS is ofset from the J2000 dynamical frame by
%a bias rotation.
%
%This is a wrapper for the function iauBp06 and some matrix operations in
%the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental
%Astronomy library.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%retVec=J2000F2ICRS(vec,TT1,TT2);

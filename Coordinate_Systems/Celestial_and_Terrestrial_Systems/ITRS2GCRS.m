function [vec,rotMat]=ITRS2GCRS(x,Jul1,Jul2,deltaTTUT1,xpyp,dXdY,LOD) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%ITRS2GCRS Convert vectors of position and possibly velocity from the
%           International Terrestrial Reference System  (ITRS), a type of
%           Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF)  coordinate system, to the
%           Geocentric Celestrial Reference System (GCRS), a type of
%           Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate system. Note
%           that the velocity correction includes the centrifugal effects
%           of the conversion from the ITRS into the terrestrial 
%           intermediate reference system (TIRS), but omits the effects
%           of the conversion from the celestial intermediate reference
%           system (CIRS) into the GCRS. The period of the Celestial
%           Intermediate Pole (CIP) motion in the GCRS is on the order
%           of 14 months and thus is significantly smaller than the
%           rotation effects of the Earth in the TIRS. The velocity
%           conversion also does not include the (small) centrifugal
%           effect of polar motion.
%
%INPUTS: x The NXnumVec collection of vectors to convert. N can be 3, or
%          6. If the vectors are 3D, then they are position. 6D vectors
%          are assumed to be position and velocity, whereby the angular
%          velocity of the Earth's rotation is taken into account using a
%          non-relativistic formula.
% Jul1, Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in terrestrial time (TT).
%          The units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%          both terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
%          bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
% deltaTTUT1 An optional parameter specifying the difference between TT
%          and UT1 in seconds. This information can be obtained from
% http://www.iers.org/nn_11474/IERS/EN/DataProducts/EarthOrientationData/eop.html?__nnn=true
%          or 
% http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/earth-orientation/eo-products
%          If this parameter is omitted or if an empty matrix is passed,
%          then the value provided by the function getEOP will be used
%          instead.
%     xpyp xpyp=[xp;yp] are the polar motion coordinates in radians
%          including the effects of tides and librations. If this
%          parameter is omitted or if an empty matrix is passed, the value
%          from the function getEOP will be used.
%     dXdY dXdY=[dX;dY] are the celestial pole offsets with respect to
%          the IAU 2006/2000A precession/nutation model in radians If this
%          parameter is omitted or if an empty matrix is passed, the value
%          from the function getEOP will be used.
%      LOD The difference between the length of the day using terrestrial
%          time, international atomic time, or UTC without leap seconds
%          and the length of the day in UT1. This is an instantaneous
%          parameter (in seconds) proportional to the rotation rate of the
%          Earth. This is only needed if more than just position
%          components are being converted.
%
%OUTPUTS: vec A 3XN or 6XN matrix of vectors converted from ITRS
%             coordinates to GCRS coordinates.
%      rotMat The 3X3 rotation matrix used for the conversion of the
%             positions.
%
%The conversion functions from the International Astronomical Union's
%(IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library are put together to get
%the necessary rotation matrix for the position.
%
%The velocity transformation deals with the instantaneous rotational
%velocity of the Earth using a simple Newtonian velocity addition.
%Basically, the axis of rotation in the Terrestrial Intermediate Reference
%System TIRS is the z-axis. The rotation rate in that system is
%Constants.IERSMeanEarthRotationRate adjusted using the Length-of-Day
%(LOD) Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP). Thus, in the TIRS, the angular
%velocity vector is [0;0;omega], where omega is the angular velocity
%accounting for the LOD EOP. Consequently, one account for rotation by
%transforming from the ITRS to the TIRS, adding the cross product of
%Omega with the position in the TIRS, and then converting to the GCRS.
%This is a simple Newtonian conversion.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[vec,rotMat]=ITRS2GCRS(x,Jul1,Jul2);
%or if more parameters are known,
%[vec,rotMat]=ITRS2GCRS(x,Jul1,Jul2,deltaTTUT1,xpyp,dXdY,LOD);
%
%Different celestial coordinate systems are compared in [1].

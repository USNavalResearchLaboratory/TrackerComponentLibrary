/**G2ICRS Rotate vectors from the orientation of the International
 *        Astronomical Union's (IAU's) 1958 system of galactic coordinates
 *        to that of the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS).
 *        This function works with Cartesian vectors and with two spherical
 *        angles (azimuth and elevation) without range. The ICRS is aligned
 *        with the GCRS and BCRS.
 *
 *INPUTS: x The NXnumVec collection of vectors to convert. N can be 2, or
 *          3. If the vectors are 2D, then they are assumed to be azimuth
 *          and elevation in radians. 3D vectors are assumed to be
 *          Cartesian position.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: xICRS The vectors rotated into the galactic coordinates. If the
 *               input was 2D azimuth and elevation, the output will be the
 *               same. If the input was Cartesian, then the output will be
 *               Cartesian.
 *
 *This is mostly a wrapper for the function iauG2icrs in the International
 *Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library.
 *
 *The original coordinate system is defined in [1]. However, as documented
 *in the IAU's function iauG2icrs, the Galactic coordinate system has been
 *redefined in terms of more accurate modern data.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *xICRS=G2ICRS(x,Jul1,Jul2);

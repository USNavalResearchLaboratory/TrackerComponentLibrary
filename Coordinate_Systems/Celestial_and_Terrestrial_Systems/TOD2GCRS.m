function [xRot,rotMat]=TOD2GCRS(xVec,TT1,TT2,dXdY) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%TOD2GCRS Rotate a vector from the true equator and equinox of date
%          coordinate system (TOD) using the IAU 2006/2000A model, where a
%          location is known as an "apparent place", to the geocentric
%          celestial reference system (GCRS). The transformation is
%          performed by removing the precession, nutation, and frame bias.
%
%INPUTS:  xVec The 3XN matrix of N 3X1 Cartesian vectors that are to be
%              rotated from the TOD into the GCRS coordinate system.
% TT1, TT2 Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TT. The units of
%              the date are days. The full date is the sum of both terms.
%              The date is broken into two parts to provide more bits of
%              precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
%         dXdY dXdY=[dX;dY] are the celestial pole offsets with respect to
%              the IAU 2006/2000A precession/nutation model in radians If
%              this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the
%              value from the function getEOP will be used.
%
%OUTPUTS: xRot The 3XN matrix of the N 3X1 input vector rotated into the
%              GCRS coordinate system.
%       rotMat The 3X3 rotation matrix such that
%              xRot(:,i)=rotMat*xVec(:,i).
%
%This uses functions in the International Astronomical Union's (IAU)
%Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) library to obtain the product
%of the nutation and precession rotation matrices  and the frame rotation
%bias matrix. One goes from GCRS to TOD by applying a frame bias and then
%precession and a nutation. Thus this function removes those rotations.
%The rotations are discussed in the documentation for the SOFA library as
%well as in among other sources.
%
%The correction for using dXdY is the most accurate formula in [2].
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[xRot,rotMat]=TOD2GCRS(xVec,TT1,TT2);
%or
%[xRot,rotMat]=TOD2GCRS(xVec,TT1,TT2,dXdY);

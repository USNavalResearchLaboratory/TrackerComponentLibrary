function [xRot,rotMat]=MOD2GCRS(xVec,TT1,TT2) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%MOD2GCRS Rotate a vector from the mean of date (MOD) coordinate system,
%          which is the coordinate system using the mean equinox and
%          ecliptic of date, to the geocentric celestial reference system
%          (GCRS) using the IAU 2006/2000A model. The transformation is
%          performed by removing the precession and frame bias.
%
%INPUTS: xVec The 3XN matrix of N 3X1 Cartesian vectors that are to be
%             rotated from the MOD coordinate system into the GCRS
%             coordinate system.
%    TT1, TT2 Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TT. The units
%             of the date are days. The full date is the sum of both
%             terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
%             bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
%
%OUTPUTS: xRot The 3XN matrix of the N 3X1 input vector rotated into the
%               GCRS coordinate system.
%        rotMat The 3X3 rotation matrix such that
%               xRot(:,i)=rotMat*xVec(:,i).
%
%This uses functions in the International Astronomical Union's (IAU)
%Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) library to obtain the product
%of the precession rotation matrix and the frame rotation bias matrix. One
%goes from GCRS to mean of date by applying a frame bias and then
%precession. Thus this function removes those rotations. The rotations are
%discussed in the documentation for the SOFA library as well as in
%G. Petit and B. Luzum, IERS Conventions (2010), International Earth
%Rotation and Reference Systems Service Std. 36, 2010.
%among other sources.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[xRot,rotMat]=MOD2GCRS(xVec,TT1,TT2);
%
%Different celestial coordinate systems are compared in [1].

/**GCRS2MOD Rotate a vector from the geocentric celestial reference system
 *          (GCRS) to the mean of date (MOD) coordinate system, which is
 *          the coordinate system using the mean equinox and
 *          ecliptic of date, IAU 2006/2000A model. The transformation is
 *          performed by adding the precession and frame bias.
 *
 *INPUTS: xVec The 3XN matrix of N 3X1 Cartesian vectors that are to be
 *             rotated from the GCRS coordinate system into the MOD
 *             coordinate system.
 * TT1, TT2 Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TT. The units
 *             of the date are days. The full date is the sum of both
 *             terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
 *             bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is
 *             split.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: xRot The 3XN matrix of the N 3X1 input vector rotated into the
 *              MOD coordinate system.
 *       rotMat The 3X3 rotation matrix such that
 *              xRot(:,i)=rotMat*xVec(:,i).
 *
 *This uses functions in the International Astronomical Union's (IAU)
 *Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) library to obtain the product
 *of the precession rotation matrix and the frame rotation bias matrix. One
 *goes from GCRS to mean of date by applying a frame bias and then
 *precession. Thus this function removes those rotations. The rotations are
 *discussed in the documentation for the SOFA library as well as in [1]
 *among other sources.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *[xRot,rotMat]=GCRS2MOD(xVec,TT1,TT2);
 *
 *Different celestial coordinate systems are compared in [2].

/**ICRS2J2000F Convert vectors from the International Celestial Reference
 *             System (ICRS) to the J2000.0 dynamical frame. This involves
 *             removing a frame bias rotation.
 *
 *INPUTS: vec The 3XN matrix of N vectors that are to be rotated rom the
 *            ICRS to the J2000.0 dynamical frame.
 *   TT1, TT2 Two parts of a Julian date given in terrestrial time (TT).
 *            The units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
 *            both terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
 *            bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: retVec The 3XN set of vectors rotated into the J2000.0 dynamical
 *                frame.
 *
 *As described in [1], the ICRS is ofset from the J2000 dynamical frame by
 *a bias rotation.
 *
 *This is a wrapper for the function iauBp06 and some matrix operations in
 *the International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental
 *Astronomy library.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *retVec=ICRS2J2000F(vec,TT1,TT2);

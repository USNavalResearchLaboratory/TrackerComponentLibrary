function xICRS=G2ICRS(x,Jul1,Jul2) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%G2ICRS Rotate vectors from the orientation of the International
%        Astronomical Union's (IAU's) 1958 system of galactic coordinates
%        to that of the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS).
%        This function works with Cartesian vectors and with two spherical
%        angles (azimuth and elevation) without range. The ICRS is aligned
%        with the GCRS and BCRS.
%
%INPUTS: x The NXnumVec collection of vectors to convert. N can be 2, or
%          3. If the vectors are 2D, then they are assumed to be azimuth
%          and elevation in radians. 3D vectors are assumed to be
%          Cartesian position.
%
%OUTPUTS: xICRS The vectors rotated into the galactic coordinates. If the
%               input was 2D azimuth and elevation, the output will be the
%               same. If the input was Cartesian, then the output will be
%               Cartesian.
%
%This is mostly a wrapper for the function iauG2icrs in the International
%Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library.
%
%The original coordinate system is defined in [1]. However, as documented
%in the IAU's function iauG2icrs, the Galactic coordinate system has been
%redefined in terms of more accurate modern data.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%xICRS=G2ICRS(x,Jul1,Jul2);

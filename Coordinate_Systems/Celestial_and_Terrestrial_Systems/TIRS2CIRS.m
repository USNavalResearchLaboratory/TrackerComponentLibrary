function [vec,rotMat]=TIRS2CIRS(x,Jul1,Jul2,deltaTTUT1,LOD) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%TIRS2CIRS Convert vectors of position and possibly velocity from the
%           Terrestrial Intermediate Reference System (TIRS) to the
%           Celestial Intermediate Reference System (CIRS).
%
%INPUTS: x The NXnumVec collection of vectors to convert. N can be 3, or
%          6. If the vectors are 3D, then they are position. 6D vectors
%          are assumed to be position and velocity, whereby the angular
%          velocity of the Earth's rotation is taken into account using a
%          non-relativistic formula.
% Jul1, Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in terrestrial time (TT).
%          The units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%          both terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
%          bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
% deltaTTUT1 An optional parameter specifying the difference between TT
%          and UT1 in seconds. This information can be obtained from
%          http://www.iers.org/nn_11474/IERS/EN/DataProducts/EarthOrientationData/eop.html?__nnn=true
%          or 
%          http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/earth-orientation/eo-products
%          If this parameter is omitted or if an empty matrix is passed,
%          then the value provided by the function getEOP will be used
%          instead.
%      LOD The difference between the length of the day using terrestrial
%          time, international atomic time, or UTC without leap seconds
%          and the length of the day in UT1. This is an instantaneous
%          parameter (in seconds) proportional to the rotation rate of the
%          Earth. This is only needed if more than just position
%          components are being converted.
%
%OUTPUTS: vec A 3XN or 6XN matrix of vectors converted from TIRS
%             coordinates to CIRS coordinates.
%      rotMat The 3X3 rotation matrix used for the conversion of the
%             positions.
%
%The conversion functions from the International Astronomical Union's
%(IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library are put together to get
%the necessary rotation matrix for the position.
%
%The velocity transformation deals with the instantaneous rotational
%velocity of the Earth using a simple Newtonian velocity addition.
%Basically, the axis of rotation in the Terrestrial Intermediate Reference
%System TIRS is the z-axis. The rotation rate in that system is
%Constants.IERSMeanEarthRotationRate adjusted using the Length-of-Day
%(LOD) Earth Orientation Parameter (EOP). Thus, in the TIRS, the angular
%velocity vector is [0;0;omega], where omega is the angular velocity
%accounting for the LOD EOP. Consequently, one accounts for rotation by
%transforming from the GCRS to the TIRS, and subtracting the cross product
%of Omega with the position in the TIRS.
%This is a simple Newtonian conversion.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[vec,rotMat]=TIRS2CIRS(x,Jul1,Jul2);
%or if more parameters are known,
%[vec,rotMat]=TIRS2CIRS(x,Jul1,Jul2,deltaTTUT1,LOD);
%
%Different celestial coordinate systems are compared in [1].

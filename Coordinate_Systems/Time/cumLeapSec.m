function numSec=cumLeapSec(year,month,day,dayFrac) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%CUMLEAPSEC Get the cumulative number of leap seconds up to a given date
%            for one or more dates given in matrices. The result is the
%            difference between atomic international time (TAI) and
%            universal coordinated time (UTC). The result is not always an
%            integer prior to 1972, because non whole second adjustments
%            were added back then. The results are only valid from the
%            start of UTC, which was on 1960 January 1.0.
%
%INPUTS: year A matrix of integer years in the Gregorian calendar under
%             UTC time.
%       month A matrix of integer months in the Gregorian calendar under
%             UTC time. 1<=month<=12
%         day A matrix of integer days in the Gregorian calendar under
%             UTC time. Days count from 1.   
%     dayFrac A parameter that is only neded for years prior to 1972,
%             because of the unusual manner in which time corrections were
%             applied back then. The fraction of a day must be between 0
%             and 1 for each element in the matrix. If this parameter is
%             omitted, then a value of zero is used for all dates.
%
%This function is just a wrapper for the function iaudat in the
%International Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental
%Astronomy library. If the year in question is too far into the future
%(from the version of the IAU's function) the function will issue a
%warning message as it does not hold a record of future leap seconds and
%leap seconds are not accurately precitable.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%numSec=cumLeapSec(year,month,day);
%for 1972 onwards and the format
%numSec=cumLeapSec(year,month,day,dayFrac);
%for dates prior to 1972.

function epochJ=JulDate2JulEpoch(Jul1,Jul2) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%JULDATE2JULEPOCH Convert two-part Julian dates given in a uniform
%                  timescale, such as terrestrial time (TT) date to a
%                  Julian epoch in the same scale. The timescale
%                  should be uniform (i.e. not UTC).
%
%INPUTS: Jul1, Jul2  Matrices of two parts of a Julian date given in the 
%                    same timescale as the epoch The units of the date are
%                    days. The full date is the sum of both terms. The
%                    entries in the matrices correspond to different
%                    dates to be converted.
%
%OUTPUTS: epochJ A matrix of Julian epochs as fractional years in the same
%                timescale as the input.
%
%A Julian epoch is a factional year number denominated in terms of a
%year of exactly 365.25 days in TT. For example 2000.5 is a Julian epoch
%in the middle of the year 2000.
%
%This is a wrapper for the function iauEpj in the International
%Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%epochJ=JulDate2JulEpoch(Jul1,Jul2);

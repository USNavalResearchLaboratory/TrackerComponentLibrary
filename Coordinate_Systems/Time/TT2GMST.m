function GMST=TT2GMST(Jul1,Jul2,version,deltaT) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%TT2GMST Convert from terrestrial time (TT) to Greenwhich mean sidereal
%         time (GMST), which is a measure of the rotational direction of
%         the Earth.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a pseudo-Julian date given in TT. The
%                  units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%                  both terms. The date is broken into two parts to
%                  provide more bits of precision. It does not matter how
%                  the date is split.
%          version An optional integer specifying the theory to use for
%                  GMST. The theory chosen should be consistent with other
%                  values used in astronomical routines. Possible values
%                  are
%                  1982 Compute GMST ion accordance with the International
%                     Astronomical Union's (IAU's) 1982 model.
%                  2000 Compute GMST in line with IAU 2000 resolutions
%                     related to precession and nutation.
%                  2006 (The default if omitted) Compute GMST in line with
%                     IAU 2006 resolutions related to precession and
%                     nutation.
%           deltaT An optional parameter specifying the offset between TT
%                  and UT1 in seconds. If this parameter is omitted, then
%                  the value of the function getEOP will be used.
%
%OUTPUTS: GMST The Greenwhich mean sidereal time in radians. 
%
%GMST is defined in Section 5.5.7 of [1].
%
%This is a wrapper for the functions iauTtut1 and iauGmst82, iauGmst00,
%and iauGmst06 in the International Astronomical Union's Standards of
%Fundamental Astronomy library.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%GMST=TT2GMST(Jul1,Jul2);
%or
%GMST=TT2GMST(Jul1,Jul2,version);
%or
%GMST=TT2GMST(Jul1,Jul2,version,deltaT);

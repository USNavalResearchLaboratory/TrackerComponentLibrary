function [Jul1,Jul2]=TAI2TT(Jul1,Jul2) %#ok<INUSD>
%%TAI2TT Convert from international atomic time (TAI) given as a two-part
%        Julian date to terrestrial time (TT), represented as a two-part
%        Julian date.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1, Jul2 Matrices of two parts of a Julian date given in TAI.
%                   The units of the date are days. The full date is the
%                   sum of both terms. The date is broken into two parts
%                   to provide more bits of precision. It does not matter
%                   how the date is split. Corresponding elements in each
%                   matrix are times that are converted.
%
%OUTPUTS: Jul1, Jul2 The time as a Julian date in TT with the same
%                    dimensionalities as the input sets of dates.
%
%This is a mex wrapper for the function iauTaitt in the International
%Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TAI2TT(Jul1,Jul2);
%
%Many temporal coordinate systems standards are compared in [1].

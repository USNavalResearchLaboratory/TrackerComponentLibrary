function [Jul1,Jul2]=TT2TCB(Jul1,Jul2,deltaT,clockLoc) %#ok<INUSD>
%%TT2TCB Convert from terrestrial time (TT) to barycentric coordinate
%        time (TCB) to an accuracy of nanoseconds (if deltaT is accurate)
%        using the routines from the International Astronomical Union's
%        library that do not require external ephemeris data.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TT. The units of
%                  the date are days. The full date is the sum of both
%                  terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide
%                  more bits of precision. It does not matter how the date
%                  is split.
%           deltaT An optional parameter specifying the offset between TT
%                  and UT1 in seconds. If this parameter is omitted or an
%                  empty matrix is passed, then the value of the function
%                  getEOP will be used.
%         clockLoc An optional 3X1 vector specifying the location of the
%                  clock in WGS-84 ECEF Cartesian [x;y;z] coordinates with
%                  units of meters. Due to relativistic effects, clocks
%                  that are synchronized with respect to TT are not
%                  synchronized with respect to TCB. If this parameter is
%                  omitted, then a clock at the center of the Earth is
%                  used and the precision declines to microseconds.
%        
%OUTPUTS:Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TCB.
%
%This function relies on a number of functions in the International
%Astronomical Union's Standards of Fundamental Astronomy library. The time
%is first converted to barycentric dynamical time (TDB) and then to
%barycentric coordinated time (TCB).
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TT2TCB(Jul1,Jul2);
%or
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TT2TCB(Jul1,Jul2,deltaT);
%or
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TT2TCB(Jul1,Jul2,deltaT,clockLoc);
%
%Many temporal coordinate systems standards are compared in [1].

function [year,dayCount,second]=UTC2DayCount(Jul1,Jul2) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%UTC2DAYCOUNT A function for converting a universal coordinated time
%              (UTC) given as a two-part pseudo-Julian to a date in terms
%              of the year, day number and second in the day.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1, Jul2 Vectors or matrices of the two parts of Julian dates
%                   given in UTC. The units of the date are days. The full
%                   date is the sum of both terms. The date is broken into
%                   two parts to provide more bits of precision. It does
%                   not matter how the date is split.
%
%OUTPUTS: year A matrix of integer years (as Matlab doubles) in the
%              Gregorian calendar under UTC corresponding to the input
%              dates.
%     dayCount A matrix integer days of the year (as Matlab doubles),
%              accounting for leap years, corresponding to the input
%              dates. Values in dayCount are integers >=1.
%       second A matrix of the (possibly fractional) seconds of the day,
%              accounting for leap seconds, corresponding to the input
%              dates. Values in second are >=0.
%
%This makes use of the function iauJd2cal in the International
%Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library
%whereby the output from that function is transformed to be in terms of
%hours minutes and seconds rather than as a fraction of a day.
%The day from which the fraction is taken is assumed to have 24 hours,
%with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute.
%
%The UTC date is only pseudo-Julian, because there is not a fixed number
%of seconds in a Julian day. The convention used in the IAU standard is
%that the Julian day matches the UTC day regardless of whether the UTC day
%is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds (depending on the presence of leap
%seconds).
%
%Leap years are taken into account. February has 29 days if the year is
%divisible by 4, unless the year is divisible by 100 unless the year is
%divisible by 400. Leap seconds are also taken into account.
%
%UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and this function should not
%be called with an earlier date.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[year,dayCount,second]=UTC2DayCount(Jul1,Jul2);

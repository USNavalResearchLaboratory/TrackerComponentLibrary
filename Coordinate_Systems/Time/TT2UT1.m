function [Jul1,Jul2]=TT2UT1(Jul1,Jul2,deltaT) %#ok<INUSD>
%%TT2UT1 Convert from terrestrial time (TT) to UT1, which is a nonuniform
%        timescale based on the rotation rate of the Earth.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TT. The
%                  units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%                  both terms. The date is broken into two parts to
%                  provide more bits of precision. It does not matter how
%                  the date is split.
%           deltaT An optional parameter specifying the offset between TT
%                  and UT1 in seconds. If this parameter is omitted, then
%                  the value of the function getEOP will be used.
%
%OUTPUTS: Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date in UT1.
%
%This is a wrapper for the function iauTtut1 in the International
%Astronomical Union's Standards of Fundamental Astronomy library.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TT2UT1(Jul1,Jul2);
%or
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TT2UT1(Jul1,Jul2,deltaT);
%
%Many temporal coordinate systems standards are compared in [1].

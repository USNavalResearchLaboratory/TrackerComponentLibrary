function [Jul1,Jul2]=TT2TDB(Jul1,Jul2,deltaTTUT1,clockLoc) %#ok<INUSD>
%%TT2TDB Convert from terrestrial time (TT) to barycentric dynamical time
%        (TDB) to an accuracy of nanoseconds (if deltaT is accurate)
%        using the routines from the International Astronomical Union's
%        library that do not require external ephemeris data.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TT. The units of
%                  the date are days. The full date is the sum of both
%                  terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide
%                  more bits of precision. It does not matter how the date
%                  is split.
%       deltaTTUT1 An optional parameter specifying the offset between TT
%                  and UT1 in seconds. If this parameter is omitted or an
%                  empty matrix is passed, then the value of the function
%                  getEOP will be used.
%         clockLoc An optional 3X1 vector specifying the location of the
%                  clock in the Terrestrial Intermediate Reference System
%                  (TIRS), though it would not make much of a difference
%                  if the International Terrestrial Reference System
%                  (ITRS) were used. The units are meters. Due to
%                  relativistic effects, clocks that are synchronized with
%                  respect to TT are not synchronized with respect to TDB.
%                  If this parameter is omitted, then a clock at the
%                  center of the Earth is used.
%        
%OUTPUTS:Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in TDB.
%
%This function relies on a number of functions in the International
%Astronomical Union's Standards of Fundamental Astronomy library. The
%implementation is essentially the same as TT2TCB except a final
%conversion step is omitted.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TT2TDB(Jul1,Jul2,deltaTTUT1,clockLoc);
%or
%[Jul1,Jul2]=TT2TDB(Jul1,Jul2);
%
%Many temporal coordinate systems standards are compared in [1].

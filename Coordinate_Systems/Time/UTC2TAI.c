/**UTC2TAI Convert from universal coordinated time (UTC) given as a two-
 *         part pseudo-Julian date to international atomic time (TAI),
 *         represented as a two-part pseudo-Julian date.
 *
 *INPUTS: Jul1, Jul2 Matrices of two parts of a pseudo-Julian date given in
 *                   UTC. The units of the date are days. The full date is
 *                   the sum of both terms. The date is broken into two
 *                   parts to provide more bits of precision. It does not
 *                   matter how the date is split. Corresponding elements
 *                  in each matrix are times that are converted.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: Jul1, Jul2 The time as a Julian date in TAI with the same
 *                     dimensionalities as the input sets of dates.
 *   
 *This is a mex wrapper for the function iauUtctai in the International
 *Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library.
 *The UTC date is only pseudo-Julian, because there is not a fixed number
 *of seconds in a Julian day. The convention used in the IAU standard is
 *that the Julian day matches the UTC day regardless of whether the UTC day
 *is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds (depending on the presence of leap
 *seconds).
 *
 *UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and this function should not
 *be called with an earlier date.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *[Jul1,Jul2]=UTC2TAI(Jul1,Jul2);
 *
 *Many temporal coordinate systems standards are compared in [1].

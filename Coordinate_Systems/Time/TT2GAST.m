function GAST=TT2GAST(Jul1,Jul2,version,deltaT) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%TT2GAST Convert from terrestrial time (TT) to Greenwhich apparent 
%         sidereal time (GMST), which is a measure of the rotational
%         direction of the Earth.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a pseudo-Julian date given in TT. The
%                  units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%                  both terms. The date is broken into two parts to
%                  provide more bits of precision. It does not matter how
%                  the date is split.
%          version An optional integer specifying the theory to use for
%                  GAST. The theory chosen should be consistent with other
%                  values used in astronomical routines. Possible values
%                  are
%                  1994 Compute GAST ion accordance with the International
%                     Astronomical Union's (IAU's) 1994 model.
%                  2000 Compute GAST in line with IAU 2000 resolutions
%                     related to precession and nutation.
%                  2006 (The default if omitted) Compute GAST in line with
%                     IAU 2006 resolutions related to precession and
%                     nutation.
%           deltaT An optional parameter specifying the offset between TT
%                  and UT1 in seconds. If this parameter is omitted, then
%                  the value of the function getEOP will be used.
%
%OUTPUTS: GAST The Greenwhich apparent sideral time in radians. 
%
%GAST is defined in Section 5.5.7 of [1].
%
%This is a wrapper for the functions iauTtut1 and iauGst94, iauGst00a,
%and iauGst06a in the International Astronomical Union's Standards of
%Fundamental Astronomy library.
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%GAST=TT2GAST(Jul1,Jul2);
%or
%GAAST=TT2GAST(Jul1,Jul2,version);
%or
%GAST=TT2GAST(Jul1,Jul2,version,deltaT);

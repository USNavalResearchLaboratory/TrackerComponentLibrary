/**UTC2DAYCOUNT A function for converting a universal coordinated time
 *              (UTC) given as a two-part pseudo-Julian to a date in terms
 *              of the year, day number and second in the day.
 *
 *INPUTS: Jul1, Jul2 Vectors or matrices of the two parts of Julian dates
 *                   given in UTC. The units of the date are days. The full
 *                   date is the sum of both terms. The date is broken into
 *                   two parts to provide more bits of precision. It does
 *                   not matter how the date is split.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: year A matrix of integer years (as Matlab doubles) in the
 *              Gregorian calendar under UTC corresponding to the input
 *              dates.
 *     dayCount A matrix integer days of the year (as Matlab doubles),
 *              accounting for leap years, corresponding to the input
 *              dates. Values in dayCount are integers >=1.
 *       second A matrix of the (possibly fractional) seconds of the day,
 *              accounting for leap seconds, corresponding to the input
 *              dates. Values in second are >=0.
 *
 *This makes use of the function iauJd2cal in the International
 *Astronomical Union's (IAU) Standard's of Fundamental Astronomy library
 *whereby the output from that function is transformed to be in terms of
 *hours minutes and seconds rather than as a fraction of a day.
 *The day from which the fraction is taken is assumed to have 24 hours,
 *with 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute.
 *
 *The UTC date is only pseudo-Julian, because there is not a fixed number
 *of seconds in a Julian day. The convention used in the IAU standard is
 *that the Julian day matches the UTC day regardless of whether the UTC day
 *is 86399, 86400 or 86401 SI seconds (depending on the presence of leap
 *seconds).
 *
 *Leap years are taken into account. February has 29 days if the year is
 *divisible by 4, unless the year is divisible by 100 unless the year is
 *divisible by 400. Leap seconds are also taken into account.
 *
 *UTC began at 1960 January 1.0 (JD 2436934.5) and this function should not
 *be called with an earlier date.
 *
 *The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
 *CompileCLibraries function.
 *
 *The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
 *[year,dayCount,second]=UTC2DayCount(Jul1,Jul2);

%%CAMERACOORDS2UVCOORDSCUBATURE Given Gaussian measurements in the local
%           coordinate system of a perspective camera, convert them to uv
%           direction cosines. This function does not then rotate them to
%           be aligned with a global set of coordinates.
%
%INPUTS: zCam A 2XnumPts set of [x;y] coordinates on the CCD of the camera
%          measuring the directions. This is in distance units, not pixels.
%       SR The 2X2XnumPts lower-triangular square roots of the covariance
%          matrices associated with zCam. If all of the matrices are the
%          same, then this can just be a single 2X2 matrix.
%        A A 3X3 matrix, as described in the comments to
%          cameraCoords2UVCoords. The third row must be [0,0,1].
%       xi A 2XnumCubaturePoints matrix of cubature points for the numeric
%          integration. If this and the final parameter are omitted or
%          empty matrices are passed, then fifthOrderCubPoints is used to
%          generate cubature points.
%        w A numCubaturePointsX1 vector of the weights associated with the
%          cubature points.
%
%OUTPUTS: zUV The 2XnumPts approximate means of the PDF of the polar
%             measurements converted to [x;y] Cartesian coordinates.
%       RCart The 2X2XnumPts set of approximate covariance matrices for the
%             numPts estimates.
%
%Details of the numerical integration used in the conversion are given in
%[1]. The perspective camera model is in [2] and more details on the model
%used are given in the comments to cameraCoords2UVCoords.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This performs a conversion and show that the converted values are
%consistent in terms of the normalized estimation errors squared (NEES).
%That is the NEES will typically lie within the 99% confidence bouncs
%(which are also evaluated here):
% numMCRuns=1e4;
% f=35e-3;%35mm camera;
% A=diag([f,f,1]);
% SR=diag([1e-4,1e-4]);
% uvTrue=[-0.2;
%          0.5];
% zCamTrue=uvCoords2CameraCoords(uvTrue,A);
% [xi,w]=fifthOrderCubPoints(2);
% NEES=0;
% for curRun=1:numMCRuns
%     zCam=zCamTrue+SR*randn(2,1);
%     [zUV,RUV]=cameraCoords2UVCoordsCubature(zCam,SR,A,xi,w);
%     
%     diff=zUV-uvTrue;
%     NEES=NEES+diff'*inv(RUV)*diff;
% end
% NEES=NEES/(2*numMCRuns)
% NEESBounds=getNEESConfBounds(0.99,2,numMCRuns)

/*CART2RUVGENCPP A C++ function to convert a Cartesian point into range,
 *           and direction cosines, possibly including the w component.
 *
 *INPUTS: retData A pointer to an array of doubles with 3 elements to
 *                hold the result in [r;u;v] order or with 4 elements if
 *                includeW is true to hold [r;u;v;w].
 *             zC The 3X1 Cartesian points [x;y;z] to be converted.
 *   useHalfRange A boolean value specifying whether the bistatic (round-
 *                trip) range value has been divided by two. 
 *            zTx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the transmitter in
 *                global Cartesian coordinates.
 *            zRx The 3X1 [x;y;z] location vector of the receiver in global
 *                Cartesian coordinates.
 *             M  A 3X3 rotation matrices to go from the alignment of the
 *                global coordinate system to that at the receiver. It is
 *                stored one columns after the other, consistent with how
 *                Matlab indexes matrices.
 *       includeW A boolean value indicating whether retData has space for
 *                a fourth component and the fourth component should be
 *                included.
 *
 *OUTPUTS: None. The results are placed in retData.
 *
 *See the comments to the Matlab function Cart2ruv for more information
 *on how this function works.

function [xECEF,MInv]=ENU2ECEF(plhOrigin,xENU,a,f)
%%ENU2ECEF Convert from a local East-North-Up (ENU) Cartesian cooridnate
%          system to an Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) Cartesian
%          coordinate system. The alignment of the coordinate axes with the
%          reference ellipsoid is the one used in common standards such as
%          that used by the DoD's WGS-84 standard and the International
%          Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service's (IERS)
%          international terrestrial reference frame (ITRF). The global
%          ECEF z-axis is North.
%
%INPUTS: plhOrigin A 3X1 point in [latitude;longitude; ellipsoidal height]
%             coordinates with respect to a reference ellipsoid
%             parameterized by a and f, derving as the origin of the local
%             ENU coordinate system. Latitude and longitude are given in
%             radians North and East.
%        xENU A 3XnumPts collection of 3D Cartesian points in the local ENU
%             coordinate system that should be converted to a global ECEF
%             coordinate system.
%           a The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid. If this
%             argument is omitted, the value in
%             Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%           f The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. If this
%             argument is omitted, the value in Constants.WGS84Flattening
%             is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: xECEF A 3XnumPts matrix of the points in xENU converted to ECEF
%               coordinates.
%          MInv A rotation matrix that rotates a point from ENU to
%               ECEF coordinates.
%
%The ENU coordinate system is a common local tangent plane cooridnate
%system. Here, we take "up" to be that described by a reference ellipsoid
%and not true gravitational "up". This limits the accuracy of the local
%coordinate system.
%
%The conversions are mentioned in [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we convert 3 points in a local ENU tangent-plane coordinate system
%to ECEF and then to ellipsoidal coordinates. In the ENU coordinate system,
%the points are offset in the North, East, and up directions. One will see
%that in ellipsoidal coordinates, as compared to the origin, there are
%respective offsets in latitude (with no change in longitude), longitude
%(with no change in latitude) and heigh (with no change in latitude or
%longitude).
% lat=19.7241*(pi/180);
% lon=-155.0868*(pi/180);
% height=0;
% plhPoint=[lat;lon;height];%Around Hilo, Hawaii.
% xENU=[0, 1e3,   0;
%     1e3,   0,   0;
%       0,   0, 1e3];
% xECEF=ENU2ECEF(plhPoint,xENU);
% latLonHeight=Cart2Ellipse(xECEF);
% diffVals=bsxfun(@minus,latLonHeight,plhPoint);
% %Convert angles to degrees
% diffVals(1:2,:)=diffVals(1:2,:)*(180/pi);
% %One can see the change in latitude on the first point, the change in
% %longitude on the second point, and no change in laittude or longitude in
% %the third point.
% diffVals(1:2,:)
% %The change in height with the third point is the full kilometer. The
% %changes with the other points is just due to the tangent point
% %approximation and are much smaller.
% diffVals(3,:)

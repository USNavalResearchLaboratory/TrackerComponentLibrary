function wrapVals=wrap2Sphere(azEl,systemType)
%%WRAP2SPHERE Given azimuth-elevation directions in spherical coordinates
%             that might be outside of the standard range of -pi to pi for
%             azimuth and -pi/2 to pi/2 for elevation, wrap the points to
%             the sphere. This function is useful when offsets (like
%             simulated noise) are added to spherical coordinates or if
%             one is performing Newton's method in spherical coordinates
%             and is likely to pass a pole. For example, if using
%             systemType=0 and elevation exceeds pi/2 by a small epsilon,
%             then it must be reduced to pi/2-epsilon and azimuth offset by
%             pi.
%
%INPUTS: azEl A 2XN set of N spherical coordinates in radians that should
%             be wrapped to the normal sphere. Each point is of the format
%             [azimuth;elevation] and the angles are measured according to
%             systemType.
%  systemType An optional parameter specifying the axis from which the
%             angles are measured in radians. Possible values are
%             0 (The default if omitted) Azimuth is measured 
%               counterclockwise from the x-axis in the x-y plane.
%               Elevation is measured up from the x-y plane (towards the
%               z-axis). This is consistent with common spherical
%               coordinate systems for specifying longitude (azimuth) and
%               geocentric latitude (elevation).
%             1 Azimuth is measured counterclockwise from the z-axis in the
%               z-x plane. Elevation is measured up from the z-x plane
%               (towards the y-axis). This is consistent with some
%               spherical coordinate systems that use the z-axis as the
%               boresight direction of the radar.
%             2 This is the same as 0 except instead of being given
%               elevation, one is given the angle away from the z-axis,
%               which is (pi/2-elevation).
%             3 This is the same as 0 except azimuth is measured clockwise
%               from the y-axis in the x-y plane instead of
%               counterclockwise from the x-axis. This coordinate system
%               often arises when given "bearings" in a local East-North-Up
%               coordinate system, where the bearing directions are
%               measured East of North.
%
%OUTPUTS: wrapVals Values of azEl that have been wrapped to the sphere in
%                  radians. azEl(1,:) ranges from -pi to pi (pi not
%                  included) and azEl(2,:) is from -pi/2 to pi/2.
%
%This function works by first converting the direction into a unit vector
%and then by converting the unit vector back into azimuth and elevation.
%The use of trigonometric functions for the first step assures the smooth
%aliasing of points over the poles and the use of inverse trigonometric
%functions for the second step places the results in the correct standard
%region.

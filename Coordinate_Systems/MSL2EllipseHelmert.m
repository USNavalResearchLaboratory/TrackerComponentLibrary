function [ellipsPoints,coeffData]=MSL2EllipseHelmert(points,tideSys,useNGAApprox,modelType,coeffData)
%%MSL2ELLIPSEHELMERT Given a point whose latitude and longitude are in 
%                    WGS-84 ellipsoidal coordinates, but whose height is a
%                    height above mean-sea level (MSL) (assuming a Helmert
%                    projection), convert the height components to WGS84
%                    ellipsoidal heights using Helmert's projection method
%                    with the EGM2008 gravitational (and terrain
%                    correction) models. This differs from the more precise
%                    but seldom-used Pizzetti's projection method in that
%                    the curvature of the plumb line is completely ignored.
%
%INPUTS: points One or more points given in WGS-84 geodetic latitude and
%               longitude, in radians, and a height above mean-sea level
%               (in meters) for the specified latitude and longitude. To
%               convert N points, points is a 3XN matrix with each column
%               having the format [latitude;longitude; MSLheight].
%       tideSys A number indicating the tide system in use. The values are
%               0: Conventional tide free. 
%               1: Mean tide (The default if this parameter is omitted).
%               2: Zero tide.
%  useNGAApprox If one wishes the intermediate tide-free geoid computation
%               to match the results of the National Geospatial
%               Intelligence Agency's code to three digits after the
%               decimal point, then this should be true. Setting this to
%               false might produce results that are marginally more
%               accurate. The default is false if this parameter is
%               omitted.
%     modelType An optional parameter specifying coefficient model to
%               load if coeffData is not provided. Possible values are
%               0 (The default if omitted) Load the EGM2008 model.
%               1 Load the EGM96 model.
%     coeffData A set of pre-loaded coefficients that can speed up the
%               computation by eliminating the need to compute them on the
%               fly. coeffData is as defined for the coeffData return value
%               of getEGMGeoidHeight.
%
%OUTPUTS ellipsPoints A 3XN array of the converted points, where each vector
%                   contains [latitude;longitude;height]; The latitude
%                   and longitude are unchanged from the input data, but
%                   the heights have been converted to from MSL heights to
%                   WGS-84 ellipsoidal heights.
%         coeffData The coeffData coefficients that can be passed to
%                   another call of ellips2MSLHelmert or MSL2EllipseHelmert
%                   to make it faster.
%
%Note that this function will be very slow if one hasn't called
%CompileCLibraries to compile the spherical harmonic synthesis functions.
%
%As described in Chapter 5.5 of [1], the MSL height using Helmert's
%projection is just the ellipsoidal height minus the geoid height. This
%function just calls getEGMGeoidHeight to get the geoidal height and
%subtracts it off.
%
%Helmert's projection calculated the height using a line from the point to
%the reference ellipsoid, subtracting off the distance from the point to
%the geoid along the line. Pizzetti's projection follows the curved plumb
%line down to the geoid. Thus, the latitude and longitude of the projected
%point on the geoid are not the same as that of the point being projected.
%The MSL height obtained is also slightly different. However, the
%difference is small and Pizzetti's projection is difficult to use, so
%Helmert's projection is almost always used.
%
%The inverse of this function is ellips2MSLHelmert.

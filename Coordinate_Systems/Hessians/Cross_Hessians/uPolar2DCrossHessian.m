function H=uPolar2DCrossHessian(azimuth,systemType,includeV)
%%UPOLAR2DCROSSHESSIAN Given a 2D azimuthal angle, obtain the second
%              derivative of the direction cosine value u with respect to
%              the azimuthal angle. This is the second derivative of the
%              output of polAng2U2D with respect to its input.
%
%INPUTS: azimuth A 1XN or NX1 set of N polar angles in radians.
%   systemType An optional parameter specifying the axis from which the
%              angles are measured. Possible values are
%              0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) The
%                azimuth angle is counterclockwise from the x axis.
%              1 The azimuth angle is measured clockwise from the y axis.
%     includeV An optional boolean value indicating whether the
%              derivative with respect to a second direction cosine
%              component should be included. The u direction cosine is
%              one parts of a 2D unit vector. If this is true, then the
%              other component is included. The default if omitted or an
%              empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: H A 1XnumPoints (if includeV is false) or a 2XnumPoints matrix
%           (if includeV is true) where the rows are u and v differentiated
%           twice with respect to the azimuthal angle at each point.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here, we verify that the second partial derivatives returned by this
%function are about equal to those returned via numeric differentiation
%(forward differencing).
% points=[0.1,-0.2,0,-pi,pi,pi/2];%Az points
% systemType=0;
% epsVal=1e-9;
% 
% J=uPolar2DCrossGrad(points,systemType);
% J1=uPolar2DCrossGrad(points+epsVal,systemType);
% HNumDiff=(J1-J)/epsVal;
% H=uPolar2DCrossHessian(points,systemType);
% 
% max(abs(HNumDiff-H))
%One will see that the disagreement is on the order of 8e-8, which
%indicates a good agreement.

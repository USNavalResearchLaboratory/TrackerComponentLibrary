function HTrans=HessianChainRule(Hf,Hg,Jf,Jg)
%%HESSIANCHAINRULE Suppose that one has a (scalar or vector) function f(x),
%    where x=[x1;...;xn] is a vector, whose gradient matrix and Hessian
%    (matrix or 3D matrix) can be evaluated. However, one wants the
%    second derivatives not of f(x) but of f(g(x)), where g is a function
%    that takes x and returns n outputs. This function converts the Hessian
%    of f given the gradient and Hessian of g.
%
%INPUTS: Hf An xDimXxDimXfDim matrix of second derivatives of the function
%           f(x) with respect to x evaluated at the point g(x). Hf(:,:,i)
%           is a matrix of second derivatives of the ith component of f.
%           For example, if f is a function of [x;y;z] Cartesian position,
%           then Hf(:,:,i) holds second derivatives in the order:
%             [d^2/(dxdx), d^2/(dxdy), d^2/(dxdz);
%              d^2/(dydx), d^2/(dydy), d^2/(dydz);
%              d^2/(dzdx), d^2/(dzdy), d^2/(dzdz)];
%        Hg An xDimXxDimXxDim matrix of second derivatives of the function
%           g evaluated at x. Hg(:,:,i) is the second derivative matrix for
%           the ith element of g. The ordering of the second derivatives is
%           the same as in Hf.
%        Jf An fDimXxDim matrix of first derivatives of the f function
%           evaluated at g(x). The rows are the elements of f and the
%           columns the element of x with which the derivative has been
%           taken. 
%        Jg An xDimXxDim matrix of derivatives of with respect to the
%           elements of x, evaluated at x. The rows select the dimension of
%           the output of g and the columns select with which element of x
%           the derivative is taken.
%
%OUTPUTS: HTrans The matrix of second derivatives of the function
%           f(g(x)) evaluated at x. The ordering of the elements is the
%           same is an Hf.
%
%This function is implemented using the identities in [1].
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%In this example, we consider a rotated coordinate system compared to the
%desired coordinate system. The function calcSpherHessian has been coded to
%allow one to specify the rotation directly. Here, we consider compare the
%explicit Hessian with the rotation to computing the Hessian without the
%rotation and then transforming the Hessian. The relative error indicates
%agreement on the order of finite precision limitations.
% M=randRotMat(3);
% x=[12;-8;16];
% xTrans=M*x;
% HTrue=calcSpherHessian(x,0,true,[],[],M);
% %The Hessian not accounting for the rotation.
% Hf=calcSpherHessian(xTrans);
% %The Jacobian not accounting for the rotation.
% Jf=calcSpherJacob(xTrans);
% Hg=zeros(3,3,3);
% Jg=M;
% HTrans=HessianChainRule(Hf,Hg,Jf,Jg);
% RelErr=max(abs((HTrans(:)-HTrue(:))./HTrue(:)))
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here, we use the example of a transformation of Rosenbrack's function
%from [1] and show that we get the correct result. It is a bivariate
%polynomial function, so an explicit solution for compairson is easily
%obtained. The absolute difference in this case between the exact and the
%transformed solution is zero.
%f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100*(x^2-y)^2;
%We use the transformation.
%g1(x,y)=x;
%g2(x,y)=x^2-y;
%
% Jf=@(xy)[-2*(1-xy(1))+400*xy(1)*(xy(1)^2-xy(2)), -200*(xy(1)^2-xy(2))];
% Hf=@(xy)[2+800*xy(1)^2+400*(xy(1)^2-xy(2)),-400*xy(1);
%         -400*xy(1),                 200];
% Jg=@(xy)[1,       0;
%          2*xy(1),-1];
% Hg=@(xy)cat(3, zeros(2,2),[2,0;0,0]);
% HfTransExact=[2,0;
%               0,200];
% xy=[15;64];
% HfTrans=HessianChainRule(Hf(xy),Hg(xy),Jf(xy),Jg(xy));
% AbsDiff=HfTrans-HfTransExact

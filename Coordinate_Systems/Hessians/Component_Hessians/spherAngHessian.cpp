/**SPHERANGHESSIAN Determine the Hessian matrix (a matrix of second partial
*          derivatives) of a 3D spherical azimuth and elevation measurement
*          with respect to 3D position. Relativity and atmospheric effects
*          are not taken into account.
*
*INPUTS: xG The 3XN position vectors in the global coordinate system, each
*          with [x;y;z] components.
* systemType An optional parameter specifying the axes from which the
*          angles are measured in radians. Possible vaues are
*          0 (The default if omitted) Azimuth is measured counterclockwise
*            from the x-axis in the x-y plane. Elevation is measured up
*            from the x-y plane (towards the z-axis). This is consistent
*            with common spherical coordinate systems for specifying
*            longitude (azimuth) and geocentric latitude (elevation).
*          1 Azimuth is measured counterclockwise from the z-axis in the
*            z-x plane. Elevation is measured up from the z-x plane
*            (towards the y-axis). This is consistent with some spherical
*            coordinate systems that use the z axis as the boresight
*            direction of the radar.
*          2 This is the same as 0 except instead of being given
*            elevation, one desires the angle away from the z-axis, which
*            is (pi/2-elevation).
*          3 This is the same as 0 except azimuth is measured clockwise
*            from the y-axis in the x-y plane instead of counterclockwise
*            from the x-axis. This coordinate system often arises when
*            given "bearings" in a local East-North-Up coordinate system,
*            where the bearing directions are measured East of North.
*      lRx The 3X1 position vector of the receiver. If omitted, the
*          receiver is placed at the origin. All vectors in x are assumed
*          to be from the same receiver.
*        M A 3X3 rotation matrix from the global Coordinate system to the
*          orientation of the coordinate system at the receiver. If
*          omitted, it is assumed to be the identity matrix. All vectors in
*          x are assumed to have the same rotation matrix.
*
*OUTPUTS: HTotal A 3X3X2XN matrix such that HTotal(:,:,1,i) is the Hessian
*          matrix with respect to the azimuth component and HTotal(:,:,2,i)
*          is the Hessian matrix with respect to the elevation component.
*          The elements in the matrices for each component/ point are
*          ordered [d^2/(dxdx), d^2/(dxdy), d^2/(dxdz);
*                   d^2/(dydx), d^2/(dydy), d^2/(dydz);
*                   d^2/(dzdx), d^2/(dzdy), d^2/(dzdz)];
*          note that each matrix is symmetric (i.e.
*           d^2/(dydx)=d^2/(dxdy) ).
*
*More details are given in the native Matlab implementation.
*
*The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the 
* CompileCLibraries function.
*
*The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
*HTotal=spherAngHessian(xG,systemType,lRx,M);

function L=LorentzTransMatrix(vVec,vectorType,c)
%%LORENTZTRANSMATRIX  Get the matrix for the Lorentz transformation of
%                     time-space vectors between two inertial coordinate
%                     systems. The Lorentz transform embodies the
%                     coordinate system transformation inherent to special
%                     relativity theory and plays a role in transforming
%                     space-time vectors. The matrix can be obtained for
%                     the case where an interval is specified as
%                     z=[c*Delta t;Delta x']' (the real case), where c is
%                     the speed of light, Delta t is a time interval, and x
%                     is a 3D distance vector, or for the case where
%                     z=[Delta t;Delta x']' (the real, asymmetric case), or
%                     for the case where an interval is specified as
%                     z=[1i*c*Delta t;Delta x']' where 1i=sqrt(-1).
%
%INPUTS:vVec The 3X1 velocity vector of the origin of the second inertial
%            coordinate system measured with respect to the first inertial
%            coordinate system. Note that norm(vVec)<=c, where c is the
%            speed of light in a vacuum.
% vectorType A string specifying the type of Lorentz transform matrix to
%            obtain. This can be
%            'Real' The default if this parameter is omitted. All of the
%                   entries in the Lorentz transforms matrix are real and
%                   the interval being transformed is assumed to have the
%                   real form z=[c*Delta t;Delta x']'
%            'RealAsymmetric' All of the entries in the Lorentz transforms
%                   matrix are real and the interval being transformed is
%                   assumed to have the real form z=[Delta t;Delta x']'
%            'Complex' Some of the entries in Lorentz matrix can be complex
%                   and the interval being transformed is assumed to have a
%                   complex time component. That is,
%                   z=[1i*c*Delta t;Delta x']' The advantage of this system
%                   is that L is now a 4D rotation matrix.
%          c The speed of light in a vacuum. If omitted or an empty matrix
%            is passed,t he default of c=Constants.speedOfLight, which has
%            united of meters per second, is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: L If vectorType='Real', L is the symmetric Lorentz
%           transformation matrix such that if z=[c*Delta t;Delta x']' is a
%           4-dimensional vector of duration Delta t in time and Delta x in
%           3D space (c is the speed of light), in the first inertial
%           coordinate system, then L*z is the equivalent vector in the
%           second inertial coordinate system. If
%           vectorType='RealAsymmetric', then the same is true except L is
%           asymmetric and z=[Delta t;Delta x']'  If vectorType='Complex',
%           then L is the Hermitian matrix such that is
%           z=[1i*c*Delta t;Delta x']' in the first inertial coordinate
%           system, then L*z is the equivalent vector in the second
%           inertial coordinate system. Note that regardless of the
%           vectorType, inv(L)=LorentzTransMatrix(-v), because the
%           direction of the velocity of the first coordinate system
%           measured in the second coordinate system is -v. Note that
%           det(L)=1. If vectorType='Complex', the L*transpose(L)=eye(4).
%
%A derivation of the real (symmetric and asymmetric) forms of the Lorentz
%transformation can be found in Chapter 1.2.2 of [1]. The complex form of
%the Lorentz transformation and its relation to rotation matrices is
%provided in Appendix D of [2].
%
%Note that events that are simultaneous in one inertial coordinate system
%are not necessarily simultaneous in another.
%
%In accelerating systems, space-time intervals are generally obtained by
%integrating over a series of instantaneous Lorentz transformations.

function dirVecs=cameraCoords2UVCoords(zCam,A,M,includeW)
%%CAMERACOORDS2UVCOORDS Consider a perfect pinhole camera with the
%   origin at the focus and the z axis being the pointing direction. The
%   coordinates of an [x;y;z] point in that system projected on the imaging
%   plane of the camera are
%   [xImag;yImage]=-(f/z)*[x;y] 
%   (More calibrated perspective cameras will use the A matrix as described
%   in [1] and below) Considering a point zCam=[xImage;yImage] measured by
%   the camera (probably measured as pixels on a charged coupled device
%   [CCD] and converted into distances across th CCD), this function 
%   converts that point into a uv direction cosines or a full 3D unit
%   vector. It can be given in local camera coordinates or rotated into
%   global coordinates.
%
%INPUTS: zCam A 2XnumPts set of [x;y] coordinates on the CCD of the camera
%             measuring the directions. This is in distance units, not
%             pixels.
%           A A 3X3 matrix, as described below. The third row must be
%             [0,0,1].
%           M A 3X3 rotation matrix to go from the alignment of the
%             global coordinate system to that at the receiver. The z-axis
%             of the local coordinate system of the receiver is the
%             pointing direction of the receiver. If omitted or an empty
%             matrix is passed, then it is assumed that the local
%             coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(3)
%             --the identity matrix is used. 
%    includeW If only the first two elements of a unit direction vctor
%             should be returned, then this is false. Otherwise, a full 3X1
%             unit direction vector is retuned. The default if omitted or
%             an empty matrix is passed is true.
%
%OUTPUT: dirVecs A 3XnumPoints set of the directions converted to 3D unit
%           vectors. If M is omitted, they are in the local coordinate
%           system of the sensor. Otherwise, they have been rotated into
%           the global coordnate system. If includeW is false, then only
%           the first two elements are returned. In the local coordinate
%           systm of the receiver, the third component is always positive
%           (in front of the receiver).
%
%The A matrix is a calibration matrix that allows for more general
%transformations. This type of perspective camera model is described in
%[1]. The A matrix is often estimated being of the form
%A=[alpha,gamma,x0;
%       0, beta,y0;
%       0,    0, 1];
%whereas here, the more general solution assuming A has the form
%A=[a11,a12,a13;
%   a21,a22,a23;
%     0,  0,a33];
%Given a vector xVec=[x;y;z] in the local coordinate system of the camera
%(the z axis is is the pointing direction and the origin is the focus), the
%2D coordinates measured on the imaging plane are obtained as
%xInt=A*xVec;                (1)
%zCam=xInt(1:2)/xInt(3);     (2)
%In this instance, xInt is essentially a set of homogeneous coordinates and
%the final step converts to actual coordinates on the imaging plane.
%The A matrix corresponds to that of a perfect pinhole camera with a focus
%of f is:
%A=[-f,0,0;
%   0,-f,0;
%   0, 0,1];
%To solve the problem, Equations 1 and 2 and th equations for local u-v
%coordinates:
%u=x/sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)
%v=y/sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)
%Are used to eliminate x,y, and z to obtain the expressions implemented
%here for u and v in terms of the zCam. If a 3D vector is desired, then
%w=sqrt(1-u^2-v^2) and one uses the vector [u;v;w]. If M is provided, that
%vector is rotated into the global coordinate system.
%
%The inverse of this function is uvCoords2CameraCoords.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This demonstrates that the uvCoords2CameraCoords function is consistent
%with the outputs of the cameraCoords2UVCoords function. A random A matrix
%having the correct format is generated and is used to create the
%conversion. After converting uv values into camera coordinates and back,
%the error of the back-converted values is consistent with what one would
%expect due to finite precision limitations.
% uv=[-0.2,0.65,0,0.3;
%      0.5,0.7,0,-0.1];
% A=[rand(2,3);
%    0,0,1];
% uvBack=cameraCoords2UVCoords(uvCoords2CameraCoords(uv,A),A);
% AbsErr=max(max(abs(uvBack-uv)))

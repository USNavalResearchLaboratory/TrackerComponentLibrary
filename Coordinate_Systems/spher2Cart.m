function cartPoints=spher2Cart(points,systemType,useHalfRange,zTx,zRx,M,flipNegRange)
%%SPHER2CART Convert points from spherical coordinates to Cartesian
%            coordinates. If no range is specified, then the angles are
%            converted into Cartesian unit vectors. An option allows for
%            the angles to be specified from different axes. Optionally, a
%            bistatic range can be used when considering bistatic
%            measurements in a local spherical coordinate system. 
%
%INPUTS: points One or more points given in terms of range, azimuth and
%           elevation, with the angles in radians, or in terms of just
%           azimuth and elevation if Cartesian unit vectors are desired. To
%           convert N points, points is a 3XN matrix with each column
%           having the format [range;azimuth;elevation] or it is a 2XN
%           matrix with each column having format [azimuth; elevation] if
%           unit vectors are desired. Note that many math texts use a polar
%           angle (pi/2-elevation) in place of elevation. A polar angle is
%           also known as a colatitude, an inclination angle, a zenith
%           angle, and a normal angle. systemType=2 supports a polar angle.
% systemType An optional parameter specifying the axis from which the
%           angles are measured in radians. Possible values are:
%           0 (The default if omitted) Azimuth is measured 
%             counterclockwise from the x-axis in the x-y plane. Elevation
%             is measured up from the x-y plane (towards the z-axis). This
%             is consistent with common spherical coordinate systems for
%             specifying longitude (azimuth) and geocentric latitude
%             (elevation).
%           1 Azimuth is measured counterclockwise from the z-axis in the
%             z-x plane. Elevation is measured up from the z-x plane
%             (towards the y-axis). This is consistent with some spherical
%             coordinate systems that use the z-axis as the boresight
%             direction of the radar.
%           2 This is the same as 0 except instead of being given
%             elevation, one is given the angle away from the z-axis, which
%             is (pi/2-elevation).
%           3 This is the same as 0 except azimuth is measured clockwise
%             from the y-axis in the x-y plane instead of counterclockwise
%             from the x-axis. This coordinate system often arises when
%             given "bearings" in a local East-North-Up coordinate system,
%             where the bearing directions are measured East of North.
% useHalfRange An optional boolean value specifying whether the bistatic
%           (round-trip) range value has been divided by two. This normally
%           comes up when operating in monostatic mode (the most common
%           type of spherical coordinate system), so that the range
%           reported is a one-way range (or just half a bistatic range).
%           The default if this parameter is not provided is false if zTx
%           is provided and true if it is omitted (monostatic). If no
%           range values are provided, an empty matrix can be passed.
%       zTx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the transmitters in global
%           Cartesian coordinates. If this parameter is omitted, then the
%           transmitters are assumed to be at the origin. If only a single
%           vector is passed, then the transmitter location is assumed the
%           same for all of the target states being converted. zTx can have
%           more than 3 rows; additional rows are ignored. If monostatic or
%           no range values are provided, an empty matrix can be passed.
%       zRx The 3XN [x;y;z] location vectors of the receivers in Cartesian
%           coordinates. If this parameter is omitted, then the receivers
%           are assumed to be at the origin. If only a single vector is
%           passed, then the receiver location is assumed the same for all
%           of the target states being converted. zRx can have more than 3
%           rows; additional rows are ignored. If no range values are
%           provided, an empty matrix can be passed.
%         M A 3X3XN hypermatrix of the rotation matrices to go from the
%           alignment of the global coordinate system to that at the
%           receiver. If omitted, then it is assumed that the local
%           coordinate system is aligned with the global and M=eye(3) --the
%           identity matrix is used. If only a single 3X3 matrix is passed,
%           then it is assumed to be the same for all of the N conversions.
% flipNegRange An optional boolean parameter. If true, the absolute value
%           of all range components, if present, is taken before
%           conversion.
%
%OUTPUTS: cartPoints For N points, cartPoints is a 3XN matrix of the
%                    converted points with each column having the format
%                    [x;y;z]. If no range values were passed, then all of
%                    the vectors are unit direction vectors.
%
%The conversion from spherical to Cartesian coordinates is given in [1].
%However, when considering the bistatic scenario, concepts from the
%bistatic r-u-v to Cartesian conversion described in [2] are used.

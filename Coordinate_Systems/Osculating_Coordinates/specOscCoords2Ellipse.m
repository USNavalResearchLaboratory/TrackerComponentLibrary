%%SPECOSCCOORDS2ELLIPSE Given points in [latitude;longitude;height] with
%          respect to a particular sphere (usually an osculating sphere is
%          the most useful) that is defined with radius rOsc and center
%          spherCent relative to the global cooridnate system, convert
%          them into [latitude;longitude;height] ellipsoidal coordinates.
%
%INPUTS: latLonHSpherPts The 3XN set of [latitude;longitude;height] points
%               to convert from osculating spherical coordinates to
%               ellipsoidal coordinates. Latitude and longitude are given
%               in radians. If a 2XN matrix is passed, it is assumed that
%               the omitted height coordinate is zero and the height is
%               omitted from latLonHEllipse.
%          rOsc The scalar radius of the osculating sphere.
%    sphereCent The 3X1 location of the osculating sphere in the global
%               coordinate system where the origin is the center of the
%               reference ellipsoid.
%             a The semi-major axis length of the ellipsoid. If this
%               argument is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the value
%               in Constants.WGS84SemiMajorAxis is used.
%             f The flattening factor of the ellipsoid. If this argument is
%               omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the value in
%               Constants.WGS84Flattening is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: latLonHEllipse A 3XN set of points in [latitude;longitude;height]
%                    in the ellipsoidal coordinate system. If
%                    latLonHSpherPts was 2XN, then the height component of
%                    this matrix is also omitted.
%
%The use of osculating spheres is discussed in [1].

%%GETEGMGEOIDHEIGHT  Given a point as latitude and longitude in WGS-84
%                  ellipsoidal coordinates, obtain the geoid height (geoid
%                  undulation) using the National Geospatial Intelligence
%                  Agency's (NGA's) Earth Gravitation Model 2008 (EGM2008)
%                  or Earth Gravitation Model 1996 (EGM96) with
%                  the associated set of coefficients for transforming the
%                  height anomaly on the reference ellipsoid into a geoid
%                  undulation.
%
%INPUTS: latLon A 2XN matrix of N points of the form [latitude;longitude]
%              given with respect to the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid where
%              the geoid height is to be evaluated. If a batch of points on
%              a grid is evaluated, the algorithm is significantly faster
%              if points having the same latitudes are grouped together.
%      tideSys A number indicating the tide system in use. The values are
%              0: Conventional tide free (The default if this parameter is
%                 omitted).
%              1: Mean tide
%              2: Zero tide
% useNGAApprox As opposed to computing the zeroth order term of the
%              disturbing potential T and the term -(W0-U0)/gamma using the
%              gamma (magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity) that is
%              appropriate for the point in question, just use the constant
%              factor of -41cm (EGM2008) or -53cm (EGM96) that the NGA
%              uses. Also, omit a correction for differences in the value
%              of GM and the Earth's semi-major axis when computing the
%              disturbing potential T. Using this approximation makes the
%              results match the output of the National Geospatial
%              Intelligence Agency's (NGA's) code to three places after the
%              decimal point --the accuracy at which their Fortran prints
%              the output. If this parameter is omitted, the default is
%              false: the more precise method of computing the zeroth-order
%              term is used. However, one cannot assume that the estimated
%              results are more accurate.
%    modelType An optional parameter specifying coefficient model to load.
%              Possible values are
%              0 (The default if omitted) Load the EGM2008 model.
%              1 Load the EGM96 model.
%    coeffData A set of pre-loaded coefficients that can speed up the
%              computation by eliminating the need to compute them on the
%              fly. coeffData is a structure with elements C, S, CZeta and
%              SZeta where C and S have been set by the output of
%              getEGMWGS84TCoeffs and CZeta and SZeta have been set by the
%              output of getEGMZeta2NCoeffs. If this parameter is omitted,
%              the coefficients are computed during the execution of the
%              function.
%
%OUTPUTS: geoidHeight The geoid height in meters.
%           coeffData The coeffData coefficients that can be passed to
%                     another call of getEGMGeoidHeight to make it faster.
%
%Note that this function will be very slow if one hasn't called
%CompileCLibraries to compile the spherical harmonic synthesis functions.
%
%The geoid is a theoretical surface of constant gravitational potential.
%The potential used for the geoid is that implied on 
%http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/egm08_wgs84.html
%where the potential of the geoid is defined as the potential on the
%surface of a reference ellipsoid having semi-major axis a=6378136.58 and
%flattening factor f= 1/298.257686, presumably with the same value of the
%Earth rotation rate (omega) and the universal gravitational constant times
%the mass of the Earth (GM) as is present in the WGS-84 standard. Thus,
%using the function ellipsParam2Grav, the potential on the geoid can be
%found.
%
%The formula used is based on Equation 4 in the paper by Rapp [1], where
%the values of C_1 and C_2 in the paper are provided in terms of spherical
%harmonic coefficients by the NGA in the file Zeta-to-N_to2160_egm2008,
%which is loaded using the function getEGMZeta2NCoeffs(). The NGA did not
%document how the coefficients were determined. However, they require the,
%use of digital elevation data as well as data specifying the location of
%the coastlines. Additionally, high-precision computations require
%information on the density of the Earth's crust.
%
%However, Equation 4 in Rapp's paper can not be directly used because the
%reference ellipsoid does not use the same values of GM and a for the
%WGS-84 ellipsoid, with respect to which heights are evaluated, as for the
%EGM2008 gravitational potential coefficients and the geoid potential is
%not the same as the potential implied by the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid.
%Thus, the modified expression for computing the disturbing potential T of
%Equation 5 in [2] is used and the extra term in Brun's equation for the
%difference between the geoid and ellipsoid potentials of Equation 2 of the
%Smith paper is also used. The latter equations is also given in Chapter
%2.17 (Equation 2-347) of [3].
%
%This function computes the tide-free geoid height and then uses the
%conversion equations of [4] to convert to other systems. Note that a loss
%of precision compared to directly computing the geoid height in the other
%systems might be present. The differences between the tide models are
%complicated and are outlined in Figure 1.2 on page 17 in Section 1.2 of 
%[5].
%
%An overview of the math underlying the NGA's method for computing the
%geoid undulations is given in [6].
%
%With the EGM96 model, one can verify the routine using the test values
%from the NGA. These are:
%Latitude and longitude of points converted to radians.

%
%The sample values from the NGA for the EGM96 model were taken from
%http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html
%
%Similarly, the results can be compared to the NGA's implementation using
%the test values it proves for the EGM2008 model. These are:
% latLon=[37.000000  241.000000;

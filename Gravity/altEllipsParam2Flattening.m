function f=altEllipsParam2Flattening(omega,a,C20Bar,GM)
%%ALTELLIPSPARAM2FLATTENING Some reference ellipsoids, such as that of the
%                           EGM2008, are defined using a second degree
%                           spherical harmonic gravitational coefficient
%                           and not a flattening factor. This function
%                           takes the parameters of the reference ellipsoid
%                           and returns a flattening factor, so that a more
%                           standard parameterization can be used.
%
%INPUTS: omega The average rotation rate of the planet, generally having
%              units of radians per second.
%            a The semi-major axis of the reference ellipsoid, generally
%              having units of meters.
%       C20Bar The fully normalized second degree zonal coefficient in a
%              spherical harmonic representation of the ellipse's
%              potential. In older models, a J2 term is used. The J2 term
%              is related to C20Bar by J2=-C20Bar*sqrt(5).
%           GM The universal gravitational constant times the mass of the
%              planet, generally having units of m^3/s^2.
%
%OUTPUTS:  f The flattening factor of the reference ellipsoid. 
%
%The conversion is an iterative method taken from [1].

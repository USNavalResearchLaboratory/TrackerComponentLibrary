%%DEMOSTARTRAILS This demonstrates how to determine the apparent locations
%                of stars in the sky at a particular location and time
%                using the Hipparcos catalog and a low-fidelity atmospheric
%                refraction model. The stars are plotted over a number of
%                times on the same plot such that their motion in the sky
%                becomes apparent. The planets, Sun and Moon are not
%                plotted.

%It is assumed that the observer's true orientation is a rotation 60

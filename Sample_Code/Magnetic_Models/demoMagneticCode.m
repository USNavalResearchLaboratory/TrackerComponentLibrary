%%DEMOMAGNETICCODE This file demonstrates the code for spherical harmonic
%                  synthesis for evaluating the magnetic flux. Plots of the
%                  deviation of true North from magnetic North and of the
%                  inclination at the reference epoch are computed and
%                  displayed. The Tracker Component Library (that this
%                  function is part of) must have been added to Matlab's
%                  search path for this function to work.
%
%The computation of the magnetic flux on a 256X256 grid of points is
%quite fast when the mex files have been compiled. When they have
%not been compiled, then it is can be very slow. Consequently, the file 
%CompileCLibraries should have been run prior to executing this example
%script.

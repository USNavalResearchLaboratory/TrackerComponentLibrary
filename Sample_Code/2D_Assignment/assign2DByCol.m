function [col4row, row4col, gain, u, v]=assign2DByCol(C,maximize)
%%ASSIGN2DBYCOL Solve the two-dimensional assignment problem with a
%               rectangular cost matrix C, scanning column-wise.
%
%INPUTS: C A numRowXnumCol cost matrix that does not contain any NaNs and
%          where the largest finite element minus the smallest element is a
%          finite quantity (does not overflow) when performing minimization
%          and where the smallest finite element minus the largest element
%          is finite when performing maximization. Forbidden assignments
%          can be given costs of +Inf for minimization and -Inf for
%          maximization.
% maximize If true, the minimization problem is transformed into a
%          maximization problem. The default if this parameter is omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: col4row A numRowX1 vector where the entry in each element is an
%                 assignment of the element in that row to a column. 0
%                 entries signify unassigned rows.
%         row4col A numColX1 vector where the entry in each element is an
%                 assignment of the element in that column to a row. 0
%                 entries signify unassigned columns.
%            gain The sum of the values of the assigned elements in C.
%               u The dual variable for the rows.
%               v The dual variable for the columns.
%
%DEPENDENCIES: None
%
%If the number of rows is <= the number of columns, then every row is
%assigned to one column; otherwise every column is assigned to one row. The
%assignment minimizes the sum of the assigned elements (the gain).
%During minimization, assignments can be forbidden by placing Inf in
%elements. During maximization, assignment can be forbidden by placing -Inf
%in elements. The cost matrix can not contain any -Inf elements during
%minimization nor any +Inf elements during mazimization to try to force an
%assignment. If no complete assignment can be made with finite cost,
%then col4row and row4col are empty and gain is set to -1.
%
%The algorithm is described in detail in [1] and [2].

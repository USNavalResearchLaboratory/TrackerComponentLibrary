%%DEMOMULTIPLEMODELFILTERING This demonstrates how multiple model filters
%           can be used. The use of multiple dynamic models can improve the
%           accuracy of tracking targets than can maneuver. The scenario
%           considered is the simple 2D tracking of an aircraft. The
%           separate problems of data association, scheduling, track
%           initiation and termination are not addressed here.
%
%The example scenario is the air traffic control (ATC) scenario discussed
%in Chapter 11.7.4 of [1]. However, rather than using a fixed mode
%transition probability matrix, the use of the function
%getMarkovPTransProbMat to get the mode transition probability matrix given
%mean sojorn times and the time between samples is demonstrated. This
%allows the algorithms to be used with variable sampling rates, though in
%this instance, the sampling rate is held constant.
%
%Six scenarios are considered. One is a baseline Kalman filter with a
%polynomial dynamic model and a large process noise. The second is a Kalman
%filter with a first-order Gauss-Markov model (the integrated Ornstein-
%Uhlenbeck model), which, unlike the standard polynomial model, includes a
%correlation constant to try to better cover turns. The third is the
%reduced state filter. The fourth is the separated covariance filter. The
%other two scenarios utilize the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter.
%The first IMM scenario is as in [1], where two nearly constant velocity
%dynamic models with differing process noises are used in a standard Kalman
%filter (with the IMM). The second IMM scenario is where a nearly constant
%velocity model in a Kalman filter is used as well as a coordinated turn
%model in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The functions multipleModelPred
%and multipleModelUpdate are used to handle the prediction and mixing in
%the IMM, though a change of the algorithm selection would allow one to
%just as easily use a generalized pseudo-Bayesian 2 filter. The IMM
%estimators can be more difficult to use as there are more parameters to
%tune.
%
%The measurements are generated in Cartesian space as measurement
%conversion and tracking using non-Cartesian measurements is not the focus
%of this example.

%%DEMOCURVEDEARTHSIMLEVEL  Demonstrate the simulation of a target on a
%                     curved-Earth using a simple level-flight flat-Earth
%                     target dynamic model with the WGS-84 ellipsoidal
%                     Earth model. Geodesic and rhumb-line trajectories are

%                     for handling non-zero ellipsoidal altitudes is
%                     compared to slow, exact solutions. The trajectories
%                     are then plotted over 1000 points, where it is also
%                     demonstrated how the geodesic coordinate system
%                     evolution can be determined using explicit or

%%GAUSSMIXISELTCOVGRADS Compute the gradient of the non-normalized
%               integrated squared error (ISE) between two Gaussian mixture
%               PDFs with respect to the elements of square-roots of the
%               covariance matrices of the individual components of the
%               second Gaussian mixture. For a covariance matrix P, the
%               square root L is such that P=L*L'. However, L does not need
%               to be lower-triangular. This gradient can arise when
%               optimizing over the ISE with respect to the covariance
%               matrices. Optimizing over the square-root matrices rather
%               than the matrices themselves ensures that the covariance
%               matrices are always positive (semi)definite.
%
%INPUTS: w1 The N1X1 or 1XN1 vector of weights for the first Gaussian
%           mixture. All w1>0 and sum(w1)=1.
%       mu1 The xDimXN1 set of mean vectors for the first Gaussian mixture
%           distribution.
%        P1 The xDimXxDimXN1 set of positive definite covariance matrices
%           for the first Gaussian mixture distirbution.
% w2, mu2, P2, The length N2, xDimXN2, and xDimXxDimXN2 set of weights,
%           mean vectors and positive-definite covariance matrices for the
%           second Gaussian mixture distribution.
%        L2 The xDimXxDimXN2 set of square roots of the covariance matrices
%           in P2 such that P2(:,:,i)=L2(:,:,i)*L2(:,:,i)'.
% PDFVals12 A matrix such that the value in element (i,j) is
%           N(mu1(:,i);mu2(:,j),P1(:,:,i)+P2(:,:,j)), where N indicates the
%           multivariate Gaussian PDF evaluated at the first argument with
%           the second and third arguments being the mean and covarince
%           matrix. This parameter is returned by computeGaussMixISE.
% PDFVals22 A matrix such that the value in element (i,j) is
%           N(mu2(:,i);mu2(:,j),P2(:,:,i)+P2(:,:,j)). This parameter is
%           returned by computeGaussMixISE.
%
%OUTPUTS: gradISE The xDimXxDimXN2 set of derivatives of the ISE with
%                 respect to the elements of L2 (the square roots of P2).
% gradJhr, gradJrr In Chapter 3 of [1], the ISE is expressed in terms of
%                 Jhr and Jrr terms. These are the xDimXxDimXN2 gradients
%                 of those terms.
%
%Formule for gradJhr and gradJrr are Equation 3.45 in Section 3.3.3.3 of
%[1]. They relate to the ISE via Equation 3.20. See the function
%computeGaussMixISE to compute the ISE.

%EXAMPLE 1:
%In this example with a scalar PDF, we verify that the gradient obtained
%from this function is consistent with numerical differentiation.

function distVal=GaussianSimilarity(mu1,Sigma1,mu2,Sigma2)
%%GAUSSIANSIMILARITY This is the normalized similarity measure used between
%               two Gaussian distributions in the Appendix of [1]. It
%               ranges from 0 (completely different) to 1 (same
%               distribution).
%
%INPUTS: mu1 The xDimX1 mean of the first Gaussian distribution.
%     Sigma1 The xDimXxDim covariance matrix of the first Gaussian
%            distribution.
%        mu2 The xDimX1 mean of the second Gaussian distribution.
%     Sigma2 The xDimXxDim covariance matrix of the second Gaussian
%            distribution.
%
%OUTPUTS: distVal The scalar distance between the two distributions.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%We show the similairty of identical distribution, extremely different
%distributions, and distributions that just differ a little bit.
% mu1=[12;3];
% mu2=[2000;8000];
% Sigma1=[10, 6;
%          6, 9];
% Sigma2=[8, -3;
%        -3, 14];
% %Identical Distributions (Similarity is 1).
% GaussianSimilarity(mu1,Sigma1,mu1,Sigma1)
% %Distributions that are very different (Similarity is 0).
% GaussianSimilarity(mu1,Sigma1,mu2,Sigma2)
% %Distributions that only differ a little bit (Similarity is about
% %0.2163).
% GaussianSimilarity(mu1,Sigma1,mu1*0.5,Sigma1*0.5)

function [wRed,muRed,PRed,setParMin]=bruteForceGaussMixRed(w,mu,P,k,sequential)
%%BRUTEFORCEGAUSSMIXRED Perform brute-force Gaussian mixture reduction to
%               minimize the integrated squared error (ISE). This function
%               reduces the number of components in the original mixture
%               from n to k by computing the ISE of all reduced
%               distributions obtained by merging components (not by
%               explicitly optimizing over the final values).
%
%INPUTS: w An nX1 or 1Xn vector of weights of the components of the
%          original Gaussian mixture.
%       mu An xDimXn matrix of the means of the vector components of the
%          original Gaussian mixture.
%        P An xDimXxDimXn hypermatrix of the covariance matrices for the
%          components of the original Gaussian mixture.
%        k The number of components desired in the mixture after reduction.
% sequential When reducing the number of components to near half the
%          original value, the brute-force algorithm can be slow. If this
%          parameter is true, instead of reducing the entire distribution
%          all at once, do sequential reductions by 1 component until the
%          number of components has gotten down to k. The default if this
%          parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: wRed The kX1 weights of the mixture after reduction.
%        muRed The xDimXk means of the mixture after reduction.
%         PRed The xDimXxDimXk covariance matrices of the mixture after
%              reduction.
%    setParMin The nX1 partition of the original components that produced
%              the reduced distribution. Sets are numbered starting from 1.
%              Components within a common set were merged. If
%              sequential=true, this output is just set to the empty
%              matrix. If n<=k, then this is also an empty matrix.
%
%In the general case, all possible reductions are obtained by going through
%all length-k set partitions using the function getNextSetMPartition. This
%is more efficient than the brute-force algorithm described in [1], which
%generates the length-m set partitions in a very inefficient manner.
%
%An optimization is used to avoid needless recomputation of component costs
%when reducing the number of components by 1. However, in the general case,
%the implementation does not currently precompute merged components nor
%does it precompute PDF values in the ISE cost. However, this could offer a
%substational speed improvement at the expense of a very large increase in
%memory usage. Most execution time is currently spent in the function
%computeGaussMixISE computing the costs.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%We reduce a scalar PDF from 9 components to 5 components all at once and
%then sequentially and then we plot the results. We also record the
%execution times. Note that the full reduction on many systems might take
%over 10 seconds, but the sequential reduction will typically be a fraction
%of a second.

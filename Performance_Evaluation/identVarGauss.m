%%IDENTVARGAUSS Given a Gaussian mixture representing uncertain target
%               states, determine the normalized and regular identity (ID)
%               variances, as defined in [1]. The identity variance is a
%               measure of uncertainty in the identities of which target is
%               which given the fact that the exact positions of the
%               targets are uncertain (Gaussian). The identity
%               variance provides a metric of how confident one is in
%               which target is which. This function provides an explicit
%               solution under the assumption that the joint probability
%               distribution function (PDF) of the targets is a Gaussian
%               mixture.
%
%INPUTS: w A numHypX1 or 1XnumHyp vector of weights of the hypotheses. Note
%          that w(i)>=0 for all i and sum(w)=1.
%       mu This is an (xDim*numTar)XnumHyp set of stacked state vectors for
%          all of the targets for each hypothesis. Alternatively, if the
%          target states are all uncorrelated, this can be an
%          xDimXnumTarXnumHyp hypermatrix.
%    Sigma This is an (xDim*numTar)XxDim*numTar)XnumHyp set of covariance
%          matrices for all of the stacked mean values in mu for each
%          hypothesis. If all of the target states are uncorrelated, an
%          xDimXxDimXnumTarXnumHyp set of hypermatrices for each target and
%          hypothesis individually can be passed.
%     xDim If the targets are correlated (mu is (xDim*numTar)XnumHyp in
%          size), then the state dimensions size xDim must be explicitly
%          provided.
%
%OUTPUTS: IDVarNorm The normalized ID variance. This is a value between 0
%               and 1. Zero means that the identities of the targets are
%               completely unknown, and one means that they are completely
%               certain.
%         IDVar The non-normalized ID variance.
%      IDVarMax The normalizing constant for the ID variance.
%
%This implements the algorithm of [1].
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Two targets, two hypotheses, three dimensional states.
% mu=zeros(3,2,2);
% mu(:,1,1)=[20;-30;0;];
% mu(:,1,2)=[-15;20;1];
% mu(:,2,1)=[-15;20;3];
% mu(:,2,2)=[-15;20;3];
% Sigma(:,:,1,1)=4*eye(3);
% Sigma(:,:,1,2)=Sigma(:,:,1,1);
% Sigma(:,:,2,1)=[1,  0.5, -0.5;
%                 0.5,  2,  0.5;
%                -0.5,0.5,  3];
% Sigma(:,:,2,2)=2*Sigma(:,:,2,1);
% w=[0.5;0.5];
% IDVarNorm0=identVarGauss(w,mu,Sigma)
% %One will get an ID variance of about 0.8161. However, if all first target
% %hypothese are moved far away from the second target, then the ambiguity is
% %reduced.
% mu(:,1,1)=mu(:,1,1)+500;
% mu(:,1,2)=mu(:,1,2)+500;
% IDVarNorm1=identVarGauss(w,mu,Sigma)
% %Here, one gets an ID variance of essentially 1, meaning that the
% %identities are very clear. on the other hand, if the targets are made to
% %coincide, then the identity variance becomes zero.
% mu(:,2,1)=mu(:,1,1);
% mu(:,2,2)=mu(:,1,2);
% Sigma(:,:,2,1)=Sigma(:,:,1,1);
% Sigma(:,:,2,2)=Sigma(:,:,1,2);
% IDVarNorm2=identVarGauss(w,mu,Sigma)
% %Now, the identity variance is zero.

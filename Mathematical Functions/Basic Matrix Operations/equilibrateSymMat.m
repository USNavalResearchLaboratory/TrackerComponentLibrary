function [DAD,DInv]=equilibrateSymMat(A)%EQUILIBRATESYMMAT Equilibrate a symmetric matrix maintaining symmetry.%          This finds a matrix D such that D*A*D is such that the largest%          magnitude element in each row and in each column is 1. It is%          assumed that there is no all-zero row in A.%%INPUTS: A An nXn symmetric matrix having no all-zero row.%%OUTPUTS: DAD The equilibrated matrix. That is A pre and post multiplied by%             the diagonal matrix D.%        DInv The inverse of the diagonal matrix D. Invert the diagonal to%             get D.%%This function implements the algorithm of Sectioj 5 of [1].%%EXAMPLE 1:%Here, we create a symmetric matrix and equilibrate it. The equilibration %makes the largest magnitude values in each row and column equal 1.%However, it also worsens the condition number, as we shall show:% V=vander([1;2;3;4]);% A=V+V';% DAD=equilibrateSymMat(A);% % %The original maximum absolute value elements in the columns and rows.% max(abs(A),[],1)% max(abs(A),[],2)% % %After equilibration, the maximum mangitude elements in the columns and% %rows are all 1.% max(abs(DAD),[],1)% max(abs(DAD),[],2)% % %One can see that the condition number increased.% cond(A,Inf)% cond(DAD,Inf)%%EXAMPLE 2:%This is the example given in Section 7 of [1]. AGian, we can see that the%matrix has been equilibrated, but the condition number got worse.% A=[1,2;%    2,1];% DAD=equilibrateSymMat(A);% % %The original maximum absolute value elements in the columns and rows.% max(abs(A),[],1)% max(abs(A),[],2)% % %After equilibration, the maximum mangitude elements in the columns and% %rows are all 1.% max(abs(DAD),[],1)% max(abs(DAD),[],2)% % %One can see that the condition number increased.% cond(A,Inf)%The inital condition number is 3.% cond(DAD,Inf)%The equilibrated condition number is 16/3.%%REFERENCES:%[1] J.

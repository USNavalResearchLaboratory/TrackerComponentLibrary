function [rGCRS,rITRS]=solarBodyVec(Jul1,Jul2,timeCoordSys,objectNumber,obsState,observerCoordSys,deltaTTUT1,xpyp,dXdY)
%%SOLARBODYVEC Get a vector from a near-Earth object to a given solar body,
%              such as a planet or the Sun, including basic light-time and
%              aberration corrections. Refraction corrections must be
%              applied separately. The observer can be in the ITRS (WGS-84)
%              or GCRS coordinate systems.
%
%INPUTS: Jul1,Jul2 Two parts of a Julian date given in the time system
%              specified by the second argument. The units of the date are
%              days. The full date is the sum of both terms. The date is
%              broken into two parts to provide more bits of precision. It
%              does not matter how the date is split.
% timeCoordSys A parameter specifying the coordinate system of the Julian
%              date given by Jul1,Jul2. Possible values are
%              'UTC' Universal coordinated time.
%              'TT'  Terrestrial time.
%              'TDB' Barycentric dynamical time.
%              'TAI' International atomic time.
%              'TCG' Geocentric coordinate time.
%              'GPS' GPS time.
%              If the input is not given in TDB, then it must be converted
%              to TDB. If the input is given in TDB but the observer's
%              location is in the ITRS, or rITRS is desired on the output,
%              then it must be converted to TT. In computing TDB or TT,
%              the observer's clock is assumed to be collocated with the
%              center of the Earth --thus, no topocentric corrections are
%              applied. This might result in an often insignificant loss of
%              precision. Also, the functions TDB2TT and TT2TDB are used,
%              which are less accurate than using ephemerides to determine
%              the offset between TDB and TT.
% objectNumber An integer indicating which celestial object is being
%              observed. Possible values are:
%              1  Mercury
%              2  Venus 
%              3  Earth (geocenter)
%              4  Mars (system barycenter)
%              5  Jupiter (system barycenter)
%              6  Saturn (system barycenter)
%              7  Uranus (system barycenter)
%              8  Neptune (system barycenter)
%              9  Pluto (system barycenter)
%              10 Moon
%              11 Sun
%              12 Solar System Barycenter
%              13 Earth-Moon Barycenter
%     obsState The 6X1 location and velocity vector an observer in
%              Cartesian coordinates (in meters) in the coordinate system
%              selected by the next argument. The format is
%              [x;y;z;xdot;ydot;zdot].
% stateCoordSys The coordinate system that obsState is in. The
%              possibilities are:
%              'GCRS' The geocentric celestial reference system.
%              'ITRS' The international terrestrial reference system.
%   deltaTTUT1 An optional parameter specifying the difference between TT
%              and UT1 in seconds. Values of this parameter can be obtained
%              from
%              http://www.iers.org/nn_11474/IERS/EN/DataProducts/EarthOrientationData/eop.html?__nnn=true
%              or 
%              http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/earth-orientation/eo-products
%              If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed,
%              then the value provided by the function getEOP will be used
%              instead.
%         xpyp xpyp=[xp;yp] are the polar motion coordinates in radians
%              including the effects of tides and librations. If this
%              parameter is omitted or if an empty matrix is passed, the
%              value from the function getEOP will be used.
%         dXdY dXdY=[dX;dY] are the celestial pole offsets with respect to
%              the IAU 2006/2000A precession/nutation model in radians If
%              this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the
%              value from the function getEOP will be used.
%
%OUTPUTS: rICRS A 3X1 vector in Cartesian GCRS coordinates in meters from
%               the observer to the object, accounting for light time and
%               aberration corrections.
%         rITRS A vector in Cartesian ITRS coordinates in meters from the
%               observer to the object with any light-time and aberration
%               corrections as requested. 
%
%The relative location of the celestial body is given by the readJPLEphem
%function, which reads the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
%(NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) digital ephemerides. Light-time
%and aberration corrections are applied. Those effects are defined in
%Chapter 7 of [1]. Note that unlike the function iauAb in the IAU's
%Standards of Fundamental Astronomy library, no attempt is made to correct
%for the Sun's gravitational potential, which adds an error of up to 4
%microarcseconds. Additionally, gravitational deflection from the Sun and
%other planets is not taken into account.
%
%If getEOP has to be used, deltaTTUT1 is not provided and the time is given
%in TDB, then the terrestrial time (TT) needed for the lookup is
%approximated using TDB.

%%EGM08EARTHACCEL Get acceleration due to gravity from the Earth. This can
%            be a simple J2 model in a generic (not rigorously defined)
%            Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) or Earth-centered inertial
%            (ECI) coordinate system, or it can be more rigorously
%            defined in the International Terrestrial Reference System
%            (ITRS) or the Geocentric Celestial Reference System (GCRS),
%            accounting for effects such as polar motion, tides, and the
%            drift of the coefficients over time. The EGM2008 acceleration
%            model is used for parameters.
%
%INPUTS: rVec A 3XN (or 6XN) set of vectors of position (and velocity) in
%             meters in the same coordinate system as desired for the
%             output as specified by the parameter accelOptions. This is
%             the set of N positions where the acceleration due to the
%             Earth's gravity is desired. The velocity component is only
%             used if accelOptions specified an Earth-fixed coordinate
%             system. Specifically, if accelOptions is 0, 3, or 5. If a 3XN
%             vector is provided, but the velocity component is required,
%             the extra three elements are taken to be all zeros.
% accelOptions An optional parameter indicating the coordinate system and
%             options for the acceleration. Possible values are
%             0 (The default if omitted) The acceleration is found in a
%               generic ECEF coordinate system using either a Keplerian
%               model (if M=1) the J2 gravitational model (if M=2, the
%               default) with J2 given by the corresponding coefficient
%               from the zero-tide EGM2008 model without correcting for
%               polar motion, other tides, or the drift of the coefficients
%               over time. It is assumed that the rotation axis is aligned
%               with the z axis. Being an accelerating coordinate system,
%               Newtonian corrections for the Coriolis effect are used.
%               Values M>=3 are invalid. No Earth orientation parameters 
%               are used. The time is also not used and neither is the
%               effectsToInclude nor C and S.
%             1 The same as 0 but in a generic Earth-centered inertial
%               coordinate system, meaning that the Coriolis effect is not
%               taken into account.
%             2 The acceleration is found using the first M elements of the
%               EGM2008 model in GCRS coordinates. The additional effects
%               accounted for (beyond just using a zero-tide model) are
%               determined by the effectsToInclude boolean vector. If C and
%               S are not provided, then the getEGMGravCoeffs function is
%               used. Earth orientation parameters are used, including the
%               length-of-day (LOD) parameter for the rotation rate of the
%               Earth.
%             3 The same as 2 but in ITRS coordinates, meaning that a
%               Newtonian Coriolis term is added to the coefficients,
%               because it is an accelerating coordinate system.
%           M The number of terms in the EGM2008 model to include. If
%             accelOptions=0 or accelOptions=1, then M chooses between
%             Keplerian, or J2 models. Otherwise, the number indicates
%             the highest order of the full EGM2008 model used. If omitted,
%             or an empty matrix is passed, a default value of 2 is used
%             for accelOptions=0 or 1 and a default of 3 is used for
%             accelOptions=2 or 3. If Inf or another number larger than the
%             highest coefficient order in the EGM2008 model is passed,
%             then the total number of coefficients in the EGM2008 model is
%             used.
%     TT1,TT2 Two parts of a Julian date given in terrestrial time (TT).
%             The units of the date are days. The full date is the sum of
%             both terms. The date is broken into two parts to provide more
%             bits of precision. It does not matter how the date is split.
%             The date is only used for accelOptions=2-3. Otherwise it can
%             be omitted or empty matrices can be passed.
% effectsToInclude A boolean vector indicating which effects are to be
%             included (if accelOptions>1). If an element of the vector is
%             1, that means that the effect will be taken into account. If
%             omitted, the default is [1;1;0;0;0]; The elements of the
%             vector are:
%             1) The drift of the low-order coefficients over time, as
%                given by the getGravCoeffOffset4Drift function.
%             2) The effects of polar motion on the coefficients, as given
%                by the getAdjustedGravCoeffs4PolarMotion function. They
%                are added after tidal effects (if any).
%             3) The effects of solid Earth tides as given by the 
%                gravSolidTideOffset function.
%             4) The effects of pole tides as given by the
%                gravPoleTideOffset function.
%             5) The effects of ocean tides as given by the
%                gravOceanTideOffset function.
%         EOP A structure containing the Earth orientation parameters at
%             the given time. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the
%             values from the getEOP function are used. These are not used
%             if accelOptions=0 or 1. The elements of the structure are:
%             xpyp These are the polar motion coordinates in radians
%                  including the effects of tides and librations.
%             dXdY The celestial pole offsets with respect to the IAU
%                  2006/2000A precession/nutation model in radians.
%             deltaTTUT1 The difference between TT and UT1 in seconds
%              LOD The difference between the length of the day using TT
%                  and the length of the day in UT1. This is an
%                  instantaneous parameter (a derivative). The units are
%                  seconds.
%              C,S Optionally, the TIDE FREE EGM2008 coefficients with
%                  adjType=0 (the default) as obtained from the
%                  getEGMGravCoeffs function. Passing these saves a call to
%                  the getEGMGravCoeffs function and speeds up multiple
%                  calls to this function. These parameters are ignored if
%                  accelOptions=0 or 1.
%
%OUTPUTS: accel A 3XN matrix of the N accelerations due to gravity of the
%               Earth in meters per second squared in the specified
%               coordinate system (one for each input rVec).
%           C,S Values of the tide-free EGM2008 spherical harmonic
%               coefficients that can be passed to subsequent calls of this
%               function with the same options). Note that C and S are
%               modified (and then changed back), so care must be taken
%               with multithreading. Emptyt matrices are returned if
%               accelOptions=0 or accelOptions=1;
%
%For simple models, many parameters can be omitted.
%The J2 model in an ECEF system can be obtained using
%accel=EGM08EarthAccel(rVec)
%The function can be used for the Keplerian model in an ECEF system using
%accel=EGM08EarthAccel(rVec,0,1)
%or in an ECI system using
%accel=EGM08EarthAccel(rVec,1,1)
%The J2 model can be obtained in an ECI system using
%accel=EGM08EarthAccel(rVec,1,2)
%
%The J2 gravitational model is derived in Appendix E of [1].
%The Coriolis and centrifugal force models due to the use of non-inertial
%coordinate systems are derived from Appendix A of the same document.
%The various other effects are discussed in other sections.

function [constantNames,constantValues,kSize,ss,ipt,au_km,EarthMoonRatio,DENum,IDString]=readJPLEphemHeader(ephemerisPath)
%%READJPLEPHEMHEADER Read the header information of one of the National
%       Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion
%       Laboratory's (JPL's) Development Ephemerides (DE). These are
%       typically referred to using DE followed by a number and
%       sometimes a letter, such as DE200 or DE440t. This function only
%       reads ephemerides given in binary format for Linux (but will
%       work under Mac OS X and Windows).
%
%INPUTS: ephemerisPath This is a character string of the path to the
%           ephemeris file. The formatting is the same as used by the
%           fopen function. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%           matrix is passed, it is assumed that the DE440t ephemeris is
%           given in a data folder that is in the same folder as this
%           function and the file is named linux_p1550p2650.440t.
%
%OUTPUTS: constantNames This is a numConstantsX6 character array such 
%               that constantNames(i,:) is the name of the ith constant
%               that is given in the header file. The value of the ith
%               constant is given in constantValues(i). The available
%               constants can vary. The meanings of some of the names
%               that might be present are given below.
% constantValues A numConstantsX1 vector containing the values of the
%               constants specified in constantNames.
%         kSize The number of values in each ephemeris record in terms
%               of 4-byte binary words.
%            ss A 3X1 vector such that
%               ss(1) is the starting Julian ephemeris date of the
%               ephemeris file.
%               ss(2) is the ending Julian ephemeris date of the
%               ephemeris file.
%               ss(3) is the length of a file record in Julian days.
%           ipt This is a 3X15 matrix whose values describe offsets in
%               each of the data records to access the Chebyshev
%               interpolation coefficients of the ephemeris.
%         au_km The length of an astronomical unit as used in the
%               ephemerides, given in kilometers.
% EarthMoonRatio The ratio of the mass of the Earth to the mass of the
%               Moon.
%         DENum The number of the JPL Development Ephemerides that are
%               being used.
%      IDString This is a character string that says the name of
%               ephemerides used as well as the staring and stopping
%               Julian epoch dates.
%
%Ephemerides that can be read by this function can be downloaded from
%https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/planets/Linux/
%Only the binary file is needed. For example, when considering the DE440t
%ephemerides, the file that should be used is called linux_p1550p2650.440t.
%
%The format of the header was deduced by looking at the Fortran routine
%called testeph1.f that was created by the California Institute of
%Technology (CIT) under a U.S. government contract with NASA and is
%available for download in the folder
%https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/planets/fortran/
%
%The meanings of some of the names that might be given in constantNames
%are:
%'DENUM ' The number of the planetary ephemeris loaded. The value of
%         this should equal the DENum output of this function.
%'LENUM ' The number of the lunear ephemeris loaded. This usually equals
%         DENum.
%'CLIGHT' The speed of light in km/s.
%'AU    ' The number of kilometers per astronomical unit (AU). The value
%         of this should equal the value au_km of this function.
%'EMRAT ' The Earth-Moon mass ratio. The value should equal the
%         EarthMoonRatio value returned by this function.
%'JDEPOC' The TDB Julian date epoch at which initial conditions for
%         planets and other objects are given.'
%'CENTER' The reference center for the initial position conditions. This
%         is typically 11 for the Sun  and either 0 or 12 for the solar
%         system barycenter
%'GMB   ' The universal gravitational constant times the mass of the
%         Earth-Moon system (the Earth-Moon barycenter) in AU^3/day^2.
%'GMS   ' The universal gravitational constant times the mass of the Sun
%         in AU^3/day^2.
%'GMi   ' The universal gravitational constant times the ith planet in
%         the solar system going away from the Sun. i=1 denotes Mercury,
%         i=3, the Earth, i=8 Neptune and i=9 Pluto (regardless of
%         whether one really considers it a planet). Values typically do
%         not go over 9.
%'Maiiii' The universal gravitational constant times the mass of the
%         asteroid given by the 4 digit number iiii.
%'Xi', 'Yi', 'Zi' The position components of the ith body in the solar
%         system at the Julian epoch in  (X,Y,Z) Cartesian coordinates
%         taken with respect to the location given by 'CENTER' given in
%         AU.
%'XDi', 'YDi', 'ZDi' The velocity components of the ith body in the
%         solar system at the Julian epoch taken with respect to the
%         location given by 'CENTER' given in astronomical units given
%         in AU/day.
%'XS', 'YS', 'ZS' and 'XDS', 'YDS', 'ZDS' The location of the Sun at the
%         Julian epoch taken with respect to the location given by
%         'CENTER' given in AU and AU/day.
%'XM', 'YM', 'ZM' and 'XDM', 'YDM', 'ZDM' The location of the Moon taken
%         with respect to the Earth at the Julian epoch given in AU and
%         AU/day.
%'PHI', 'THT', 'PSI' Euler angles of orientation in radians of the lunar
%         mantle at the Julian epoch.
%'PHIC', 'THTC', 'PSIC' Euler angles of orientation in radians of the
%         lunar core at the Julian epoch.
%'RE    ' The radius of the Earth in kilometers.
%'AM    ' The radius of the Sun in kilometers.

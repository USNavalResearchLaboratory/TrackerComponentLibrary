%%ORBDET3DIR Determine an orbital (ballistic) trajectory using 3 direction
%            vectors, the number of half-orbits of the satellite between
%            the first and third vectors, the time differences between the
%            first and second and between the first and third vectors,
%            and the location of the observer at each of the times. A
%            simple Keplerian dynamic model is assumes with the
%            mass-producing body at the origin. Multiple solutions to the
%            problem can exist and it is possible that no solutions might
%            exist. Additional solutions are obtained by calling the
%            function again with a new initialization and passing the
%            known solutions as a parameter, or by using the findAll
%            option for a particular set of numHalfRevs and solSel.
%            Not all problems have a solution. Invalid solutions 
%            (those with negative ranges from the observer) can be 
%            produced and must be passed as known solution back to the
%            function when searching for additional valid solutions. Not
%            all solutions will necessarily be found. Light-time is not
%            taken into account.
%
%INPUTS: numHalfRevs The number >=0 of half orbital revolutions between the
%                    first and third direction observation.
%            obsLocs A 3X3 matrix of the Cartesian location of the observer
%                    in a (quasi)-inertial coordinate system with the mass
%                    producing body at the origin at the times of each of
%                    the three direction observations. obsLocs(:,1) is the
%                    location at the time of the first observation
%                    (usually in meters). No observer should be at the
%                    origin.
%        unitDirVecs Unit direction vectors from the observer to the target
%                    at each of the three times in the global,
%                    (quasi)-inertial coordinate system. unitDirVecs(:,1)
%                    is the direction from the observer to the target at
%                    time 1 (unitless).
%                t12 The time interval between the first and second
%                    observations (>0), (usually in seconds).
%                t13 The time interval between the first and third
%                    observations (>0), (usually in seconds).
%             solSel If numHalfRevs>1, two possible sets of solutions can
%                    be found. This selects between the two solution sets.
%                    Possible values are 0 and 1. For numHalfRevs<=1, this
%                    should be zero or no solutions will be found. For a
%                    given problem, it is possible that there are no
%                    solutions in set 1 and solutions in set 2 or vice
%                    versa, so both sets should usually be checked. If this
%                    parameter is omitted, the default value of 0 is used.
%            findAll For a given set of numHalfRevs and solSel, find all of
%                    the solutions using the method specified by Gooding in
%                    his paper.
%          knownSols A 3XnumSols matrix of known solutions FOR A GIVEN
%                    VALUE OF numHalfRevs AND solSel, where knownSols(:,i)
%                    is the ith solution consisting of the range from the
%                    observer to the target at each of the three times in
%                    order. If there are no known solutions, then this
%                    parameter can be omitted or an empty matrix can be
%                    passed.
%        rho13EstVec A 2X1 vector holding initial estimates of the
%                    distances of the target at times 1 and 3. This affects
%                    to which solution the algorithm converges. If this
%                    parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, a
%                    default initial guess based on the values of obsLocs
%                    is used.
%                 GM An optional value of the universal gravitational
%                    constant times the mass of the Earth. If omitted, the
%                    value Constants.WGS84GMWithAtmosphere is used. The
%                    units are usually m^3/sec^2.

%OUTPUTS: knownSols The input matrix knownSols augmented with the newly
%                   found solutions for the ranges from the observer to the
%                   target at each time. Invalid solutions (negative
%                   ranges) are possible and should be included when
%                   performing future calls of the function. A maximum of
%                   one solution will be found for each call to the
%                   function.
%      targetStates If a solution is found, this is a 6X3 matrix of the
%                   Cartesian position and velocity of the target at each
%                   of the three times under a Keplerian dynamic model. If
%                   findAll=true, then this is a 6X3XN set of the N
%                   solutions found. Otherwise, an empty matrix is
%                   returned if no solution is found.
%          exitFlag A number specifying the termination state of the
%                   algorithm. When no solutions exist, the algorithm will
%                   always end with a nonzero exit flag. Possible values
%                   are
%                  -1  The maximum number of iterations (100) was reached
%                      without convergence.
%                   0  A solution was found.
%                   1  The algorithm terminated because it could not find a
%                      valid estimate of the location of the target at time
%                      This is often because the Lambert problem (finding
%                      the target state at time 2 given the positions at
%                      times 1 and 3) could not be solved.
%                   2  A problem evaluating numerical dervatives arose.
%                      This can either be because no valid step size could
%                      be found, or because the gradient matrix used in
%                      Newton's method turned out singular and thus could
%                      not be inverted.
%
%The algorithm is based on the algorithm of Gooding, which is described in
%[1] and [2].
%
%Given initial estimates of the distance of the target from the observer at
%times 1 and times 3, the algorithm solves Lambert's problem using the
%function orbVelDet2Pt to determine the velocity of the target at time 1.
%The target's state (position and velocity) is then propagated to time 2
%using the function KeplerOrbitProp. If the observer-target distances at
%times 1 and 3 are correct, then the estimated target state at time 2 will
%be aligned with unitDirVecs(:,2). Gooding's algorithm correct for
%misalignment by using a combination of Halley's method and Newton's
%method. In this implementation, only Newton's method is used.
%
%To use Newtons' method, the cost function should have the same
%dimensionality as the state (the state being the distances to the target
%at time 1 and time 3) so that a unique solution for each step exists.
%Gooding uses cross products to set up an orthogonal coordinate system
%where unitDirVecs(:,2) and the current computed estimate of the target at
%time p2, p2Est, form a plane. The primary penalty function f is the
%projection of p2Est onto a vector in the plane orthogonal to
%unitDirVecs(:,2). If the two vectors align, then this projection will have
%zero magnitude. The second penalty function g keeps intermediate estimates
%in the plane. Thus, the second penalty function is the projection onto the
%normal vector of the plane. As p2Est defines the plane, this projection is
%zero. However, this definition is important for finding the derivatives
%necessary for Newton's method. The derivatives are found numerically using
%the numDiff function.
%
%The cost function to determine convergence is the primary penalty function
%f divided by max(cr,r2), where cr=dot(p2Est,unitDirVecs(:,2)) and r2 is
%the distance from the origin to the observer at time 2. The cost function
%is ad-hoc and follows from Gooding's suggestion in the text of his paper.
%
%The cost function is not convex and a step can worsen convergence.
%Following Gooding's suggestions, if a step more than doubles the cost,
%then the step size is reduced using a secant/ regula falsi method. The
%cost function is only reduced twice before another iterations is
%attempted. Forcing the cost function to always be reduced during a step
%appears to lessen the probability to finding additional solutions.
%
%Unlike in Gooding's work, an additional method of step size reduction is
%attempted if a step produces no solution. In such an instances, the step
%size is divided a few times before giving up and trying a new ad-hoc
%initialization. The ad-hoc initialization methods are from Gooding.
%Re-initialization is tried every time the algorithm fails until all ad-hoc
%initialization routines have been used.
%
%The algorithm is not a translation of the code given in the appendices of
%Gooding's paper and report, as the code was written in Fortran and uses a
%number of goto instructions, which are not supported in Matlab.
%
%When searching for multiple solutions,  the modified cost function
%described by Gooding is used to discourage convergence to old solutions.
%
%Additional information on the three-vector orbit determination problem is
%given in Chapter 7.3 of [3].

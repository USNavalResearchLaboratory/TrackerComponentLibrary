function [xState,errorState]=propagateOrbitSGP4(SGP4Elements,deltaT,TTEpoch1,TTEpoch2,opsMode,gravityModel) %#ok<STOUT,INUSD>
%%PROPAGATEORBITSGP4 Use the SGP4/SDP4 propagator to obtain the position
%                    and velocity of a non-maneuvering Earth-orbiting
%                    satellite after a given time offset. The SGP4
%                    elements are given in the obsolete True Equator Mean
%                    Equinox (TEME) of date coordinate system as is the
%                    result. The propagator is of interest,
%                    because two-line element (TLE) sets, which are sets
%                    of satellite ephemerides published by the U. S. Space
%                    Force are given in terms of SGP4 orbital elements.
%                    The function TLE2SGP4OrbEls  can be used to
%                    get orbital elements for this function from a TLE.
%                    The propagator is actually a combination of the
%                    Simplified General Perturbations 4 (SGP4) dynamic
%                    model for satellites that remain close to the Earth
%                    and the Simplified Deep Space Perturbations 4 (SDP4)
%                    model for satellites that go far enough from the
%                    Earth that the gravitational effects of the Sun and
%                    Moon begin to matter. The propagator only works with
%                    satellites in orbit, not those on an escape
%                    trajectory and is inaccurate with decaying
%                    trajectories. The accuracy of the deep space
%                    propagator, which is used when
%                    2*pi/SGP4Elements(6)>=225, is not very good.
% 
%INPUTS: SGP4Elements A 7X1 or 1X7 vector of SGP4 orbital elements for the
%                     SGP4 propagator that are close to but not the same
%                     as Keplerian orbital elements having the same names.
%                     These are:
%                     1) eccentricity (0-1)
%                     2) inclination  (radians)
%                     3) argument of perigee/periapsis (radians)
%                     4) right ascension of the ascending node (radians)
%                     5) mean anomaly (radians)
%                     6) mean motion (radians per second [TT])
%                     7) BSTAR drag term. This pseudo ballistic
%                       coefficient has units of inverse Earth radii.
%                       Normally, a ballistic coefficient BC is mass per
%                       unit area divided by a drag coefficient. The BSTAR
%                       drag term is a scaled version of the normal
%                       ballistic coefficient. That is,
%                       BSTAR=BC*rho0/2 where rho0=2.461e-5 kg/m^2. The
%                       ballistic coefficient BC is Cd*Area/mass where Cd
%                       is the drag coefficient of the object.
%              deltaT An NX1 or 1XN vector of the time offsets in seconds
%                     (TT) from the epoch time at which one wishes to
%                     determine the state of the target. Note that there
%                     are exactly 86400 TT seconds in a TT Julian day.
%   TTEpoch1, TTEpoch2 The epoch time of the SGP4Elements given in
%                     terrestrial time (TT) as a two-part Julian date (as
%                     a fractional day count). These are only required if
%                     2*pi/SGP4Elements(6)>=225, which is when the deep
%                     space propagator is used. Otherwise, these inputs
%                     can be omitted or empty matrices can be passed. The
%                     added precision of using a split date does not
%                     matter in this instance, since Vallado's SGP4
%                     library routine just uses the summed value.  
%             opsMode An optional parameter specifying the orbital
%                     propagation mode. Possible values are
%                     0 (The default if omitted) Use a model that is
%                       supposed to be similar to what the Air Force Space
%                       Command (AFSPC) uses when they publish orbital
%                       elements.
%                     1 Use a model that is supposed to be a slight
%                       improvement over what the AFSPC uses.
%        gravityModel An optional parameter specifying which gravitational
%                     model should be used. Since the gravitational models
%                     stem from ellipsoidal Earth models, the choice of
%                     the model also affects the radius of the Earth term
%                     used in the algorithm. Possible values are
%                     0 (The default if omitted). Use a gravitational
%                       model based on the WGS-72 reference ellipsoid.
%                       This appears to be what the AFSPC uses in their
%                       TLE sets.
%                     1 Use a gravitational model based on the WGS-84
%                       reference ellipsoid.
%        
%OUTPUTS: xState The 6XN target state at deltaT offset from the epoch time.
%                The state consists of position and velocity components in
%                the order [x;y;z;xDot;yDot;zDot] and is in the obsolete
%                TEME coordinate system having units of meters (for
%                position) and meters per second (for velocity).
%     errorState This indicates whether any errors occurred during the
%                propagation. Possible values are
%                0: There is no problem.
%                1: Mean element problem. Eccentricity >= 1.0 or
%                   eccentricity < -0.001 or semimajor axis implied by the
%                   elements < 0.95.
%                2: Mean motion less than 0.
%                3: Partially osculating element problem (these are derived
%                   from the SGP4Elements), eccentricity < 0.0  or 
%                   eccentricity > 1.0
%                4: Semi-latus rectum of the orbit implied by the elements
%                   is < 0.
%                5: Epoch elements are sub-orbital. This error is no longer
%                   used.
%                6: Satellite has decayed.
%
%The SGP4 propagator is described in [1] and [2]. The implementation here
%uses the code that Vallado released into the public domain with his
%paper, and which was downloaded from
%http://www.centerforspace.com/downloads/
%as an external library for performing the key propagation step.
%
%Note that this is NOT the official SGP4 orbital propagator used by the
%U.S. Space Force (and previously by the U.S. Air Force) and cannot be
%assumed to be as reliable or produce identical results to the official
%propagator. Information on obtaining Space Force's official propagator
%appears to be given at
%https://www.astrodynamicstandards.com/sgp4/
%
%The algorithm can be compiled for use in Matlab  using the
%CompileCLibraries function.
%
%The algorithm is run in Matlab using the command format
%[xState,errorState]=propagateOrbitSGP4(SGP4Elements,deltaT,TTEpoch1,TTEpoch2,opsMode,gravityModel);
%or as
%[xState,errorState]=propagateOrbitSGP4(SGP4Elements,deltaT,TTEpoch1,TTEpoch2);
%or if no deep-space model is needed, as
%[xState,errorState]=propagateOrbitSGP4(SGP4Elements,deltaT);

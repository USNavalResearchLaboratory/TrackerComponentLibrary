classdef BinaryHeapOfIndices < handle
%%BINARYHEAPOFINDICES A binary heap stores values associated with keys. At
%    any time, one can easily access either the largest or the smallest
%    key, depending on the type of binary heap. This class is specialized
%    for the case where the values are indices starting from 1 that can be
%    inserted in any order. Whereas, in a regular binary heap, there is no
%    good way to change the key of an element in the heap given its value,
%    in this class, the array idxList is maintained so that is possible.
%    idxList is the length of all of the possible values and idxList(i)
%    holds the position of the value index i in the heap. If nothing with
%    index value i is in the heap, then idxList(i) is zero. This type of
%    binary heap is useful for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, where one
%    has to increment things by value, and one knows that all values from 1
%    to some maximum size will be present (in a fully connected graph).
%
%DEPENDENCIES: KeyVal.m
%
%The methods of the class are generally based on the implementation
%described in Chapter 6.4 of [1].
%
%The class makes use of the KeyValue class for storing keys associated with
%values. The entire heap is stored in an array, which can be preallocated
%to the maximum size and thus be efficient. The class has been modified to
%keep track of idxList. The heap can be built by repeatedly calling the
%insert method. The method changeIndexedKey is not in traditional heaps;
%it lets one can change the key associated with a particular index value.

classdef metricTree < handle
%%METRICTREE A metric tree class for performing searches in a radius
%            around a given point. If a C++ class interface for the metric
%            tree has been compiled, then its functions will be called in
%            place of the Matlab routines, since the C++ implementation
%            can be significantly faster.
%
%The metric tree data structure is implemented as described in [1] and [2].
%
%This implementation builds the tree from a batch of data all at once. As
%long as there are not numerous points equidistance from a given point, the
%tree will be balanced. The Euclidean distance is used as the metric,
%though the code could be changed to replace it with almost any distance 
%metric that satisfies the triangle inequality.
%
%Note that unlike certain metric tree implementations, not all of the nodes
%are held in the leaves.
%
%Modification of the CPPData member of this class or of the error checking
%code in the members can potentially lead to Matlab crashing as CPPData is
%a pointer to data in the C++ implementation.

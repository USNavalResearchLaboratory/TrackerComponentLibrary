function [zPred, PzPred,otherInfo]=cubKalMeasPred(xPred,PPred,zDim,h,xi,w,innovTrans,measAvgFun,stateDiffTrans,stateTrans)
%%CUBKALMEASPRED Perform the measurement prediction part of the measurement
%           update step of the cubature Kalman filter with additive
%           measurement noise. The function cubKalUpdateWithPred can be
%           used to complete the measurement update. Separating the
%           measurement prediction step from the rest of the update step
%           can make the creation of multiple measurement association
%           hypotheses from a single target prediction more efficient.
%           The full measurement update function is cubKalUpdate.
%
%INPUTS: xPred The xDimXnumComp predicted target states.
%        PPred The xDimXxDimXnumComp predicted state covariance matrices. 
%         zDim The dimensionality of the output of h.
%            h A function handle for the measurement function that takes
%              the state as its argument.
%           xi An xDimXnumCubPoints matrix of cubature points. If this
%              and the next parameter are omitted or empty matrices are
%              passed, then fifthOrderCubPoints(xDim) is used. It is 
%              suggested that xi and w be provided to avoid needless
%              recomputation of the cubature points.
%            w A numCubPointsX1 vector of the weights associated with the
%              cubature points.
%   innovTrans An optional function handle that computes and optionally
%              transforms the value of the difference between the
%              observation and any predicted points. This is called as
%              innovTrans(a,b) and the default if omitted or an empty
%              matrix is passed is @(a,b)bsxfun(@minus,a,b). This must be
%              able to handle sets of values. For a zDimX1 measurement,
%              either of the inputs could be zDimXN in size while one of
%              the inputs could be zDimX1 in size.  This only needs to be
%              supplied when a measurement difference must be restricted
%              to a certain range. For example, the innovation between two
%              angles will be 2*pi if one angle is zero and the other
%              2*pi, even though they are the same direction. In such an
%              instance, a function handle to the
%              wrapRange(bsxfun(@minus,a,b),-pi,pi) function with the
%              appropriate parameters should be passed for innovTrans.
%   measAvgFun An optional function handle that, when given N measurement
%              values with weights, produces the weighted average. This
%              function only has to be provided if the domain of the
%              measurement is not linear. For example, when averaging
%              angular values, then the function meanAng should be used.
% stateDiffTrans An optional function handle that takes an xDimXN matrix of
%              N differences between states and transforms them however
%              might be necessary. If not transformation is necessary, this
%              parameter can be omitted or an empty matrix passed.
%   stateTrans An optional function that takes a state estimate and
%              transforms it. This is useful if one wishes the elements of
%              the state to be bound to a certain domain. For example, if
%              an element of the state is an angle, one might generally
%              want to bind it to the region +/-pi.
%
%OUTPUTS: zPred The zDimXnumComp measurement predictions from the filter.
%        PzPred The zDimXzDimXnumComp covariance matrices associated with
%               zPred.
%     otherInfo A structure containing members of intermediate results of
%               this function that can be passed to cubKalUpdateWithPred
%               when updating with a measurement.
%
%The mathematics behind the cubature Kalman filter are described in more
%detail in Section IX of [1] and in [2]. See the comments to cubKalUpdate
%for more information.

%cubKalUpdate in one step as with using cubKalMeasPred followed by
%cubKalUpdateWithPred.

function [zPred,PzPred,otherInfo]=QMCKalMeasPred(xPred,PPred,zDim,h,numSamples,innovTrans,measAvgFun,stateDiffTrans,stateTrans)
%%QMCKALMEASPRED Perform the measurement prediction part of the measurement
%           update step of the quasi-Monte Carlo Kalman filter with
%           additive measurement noise, as described in Section III of [1],
%           except random samples are used instead of a quasi-random
%           sequence. The function QMCKalUpdateWithPred can be used to
%           complete the measurement update. Separating the measurement
%           prediction step from the rest of the update step can make the
%           creation of multiple measurement association hypotheses from a
%           single target prediction more efficient. The full measurement
%           update function is QMCKalUpdate.
%
%INPUTS: xPred The xDimXnumComp predicted target states
%        PPred The xDimXxDimXnumComp predicted state covariance matrices
%              associated with xPred.                    
%         zDim The dimensionality of the measurement vector.
%            h A function handle for the measurement function that takes
%              the state as its argument.
%   numSamples The number of samples to use for the Monte Carlo integration
%              in the filter. If this parameter is omitted or an empty
%              matrix is passed, then a default of 100 is used.
%   innovTrans An optional function handle that computes and optionally
%              transforms the value of the difference between the
%              observation and any predicted points. This is called as
%              innovTrans(a,b) and the default if omitted or an empty
%              matrix is passed is @(a,b)bsxfun(@minus,a,b). This must be
%              able to handle sets of values. For a zDimX1 measurement,
%              either of the inputs could be zDimXN in size while one of
%              the inputs could be zDimX1 in size.  This only needs to be
%              supplied when a measurement difference must be restricted
%              to a certain range. For example, the innovation between two
%              angles will be 2*pi if one angle is zero and the other
%              2*pi, even though they are the same direction. In such an
%              instance, a function handle to the
%              wrapRange(bsxfun(@minus,a,b),-pi,pi) function with the
%              appropriate parameters should be passed for innovTrans.
%   measAvgFun An optional function handle that, when given N measurement
%              values with weights, produces the weighted average. This
%              function only has to be provided if the domain of the
%              measurement is not linear. For example, when averaging
%              angular values, then the function meanAng should be used.
% stateDiffTrans An optional function handle that takes an xDimXN matrix of
%              N differences between states and transforms them however
%              might be necessary. If not transformation is necessary, this
%              parameter can be omitted or an empty matrix passed.
%   stateTrans An optional function that takes a state estimate and
%              transforms it. This is useful if one wishes the elements of
%              the state to be bound to a certain domain. For example, if
%              an element of the state is an angle, one might generally
%              want to bind it to the region +/-pi.
%
%OUTPUTS: zPred The zDimXxComp measurement predictions from the filter.
%        PzPred The zDimXzDimXnumComp covariance matrices associated with
%               zPred.
%     otherInfo A structure containing members of intermediate results of
%               this function that can be passed to QMCKalUpdateWithPred
%               when updating with a measurement.
%
%See the comments to QMCKalUpdate for more information on the algorithm.

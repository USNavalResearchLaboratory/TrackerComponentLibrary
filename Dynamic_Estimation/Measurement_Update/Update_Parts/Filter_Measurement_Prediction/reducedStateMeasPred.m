function [zPred,PzPred,otherInfo]=reducedStateMeasPred(xPred,PPred,H)
%%REDUCEDSTATEMEASPRED Perform the measurement prediction part of the
%           measurement update step of the reduced state estimator. The
%           function reducedStateMeasUpdateWithPred can be used to complete
%           the measurement update. Separating the measurement prediction
%           step from the rest of the update step can make the creation of
%           multiple measurement association hypotheses from a single
%           target prediction more efficient. The full measurement update
%           function is reducedStateUpdate.
%
%INPUTS: xPred The xDimXnumComp predicted target states.
%        PPred The xDimXxDimXnumComp predicted state covariance matrices.
%            H The zDimXxDim measurement matrix. The measurement is modeled
%              as z=H*x+noise.
%
%OUTPUTS: zPred The zDimXnumComp measurement predictions from the filter.
%        PzPred The zDimXzDimXnumComp covariance matrix associated with the
%               values in zPred.
%     otherInfo A structure containing members of intermediate results of
%               this function that can be passed to KalmanUpdateWithPred
%               when updating with a measurement.
%
%The measurement prediction step in the measurement update step of the
%reduced state estimator is the same as that in the Kalman filter. Thus,
%this function just calls KalmanMeasPred. 
%
%The filter is taken from [1]. See the comments to reducedStateUpdate for
%more information.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%With this example, we demonstrate that one gets the same result using
%reducedStateUpdate versus calling reducedStateMeasPred and then
%reducedStateMeasUpdateWithPred.

%      8.5,    11, 13.5,   13];
% DPred=[8, 0;
%        0, 8;
%        8, 0;
%        0, 8];
% PPred=MPred+(1/2)*(DPred*DPred');
% z=1e3*[-5.498856156296510;
%        1.199241491470584];
% R=eye(2);
% H=[0, 4, 9, 8;
%    6, 3, 0, 6];
% %The update in one step.
% [xUpdate,MUpdate,DUpdate,innov,Pzz,W]=reducedStateUpdate(xPred,PPred,MPred,DPred,z,R,H);
% %The update in two steps.
% [zPred,PzPred,otherInfo]=reducedStateMeasPred(xPred,PPred,H);
% [xUpdate1,MUpdate1,DUpdate1,innov1,Pzz1,W1]=reducedStateMeasUpdateWithPred(z,R,otherInfo,MPred,DPred);
% %One will see that the one and two step updates agree.

function [xUpdate,SUpdate,innov,Szz,W]=sqrtEKFUpdateWithPred(z,SR,otherInfo,innovTrans,stateTrans)
%%SQRTEKFUPDATEWITHPRED Given the output of the measurement prediction step
%           from sqrtEKFMeasPred and a measurement, complete the measurement
%           update step of the first-order square root extended Kalman
%           filter. Separating the measurement prediction step from the
%           rest of the update step can make the creation of multiple
%           measurement association hypotheses from a single target
%           prediction more efficient. The full measurement update function
%           is sqrtEKFUpdate.
%
%INPUTS: z The zDimX1 measurement vector.
%       SR The zDimXzDim lower-triangular square root of the measurement
%          covariance matrix in the native coordinate system of the
%          measurement.
% otherInfo The intermediate results returned in the otherInfo output of
%          the sqrtEKFMeasPred function.
% innovTrans An optional function handle that computes and optionally
%          transforms the value of the difference between the observation
%          and any predicted points. This is called as innovTrans(a,b) and
%          the default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is
%          @(a,b)bsxfun(@minus,a,b). This must be able to handle sets of
%          values. For a zDimX1 measurement, either of the inputs could be
%          zDimXN in size while one of the inputs could be zDimX1 in size.
%          This only needs to be supplied when a measurement difference
%          must be restricted to a certain range. For example, the
%          innovation between two angles will be 2*pi if one angle is zero
%          and the other 2*pi, even though they are the same direction. In
%          such an instance, a function handle to the
%          wrapRange(bsxfun(@minus,a,b),-pi,pi) function with the
%          appropriate parameters should be passed for innovTrans.
% stateTrans An optional function that takes a state estimate and
%          transforms it. This is useful if one wishes the elements of the
%          state to be bound to a certain domain. For example, if an
%          element of the state is an angle, one should generally want to
%          bind it to the region +/-pi.
%
%OUTPUTS: xUpdate The xDimXnumComp updated state vectors.
%         SUpdate The updated xDimXxDimXnumComp lower-triangular square-
%                 root state covariance matrices.
%      innov, Szz The zDimXnumComp innovations and the zDimXzDimXnumComp
%                 square-root innovation covariance matrices are returned
%                 in case one wishes to analyze the consistency of the
%                 estimator or use those values in gating or likelihood
%                 evaluation.
%               W The xDimXzDimXnumComp gains used in the update.

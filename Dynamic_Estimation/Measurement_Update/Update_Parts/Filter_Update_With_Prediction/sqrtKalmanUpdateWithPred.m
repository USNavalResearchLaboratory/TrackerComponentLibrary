function [xUpdate, SUpdate,innov,Szz,W]=sqrtKalmanUpdateWithPred(z,SR,otherInfo)
%%SQRTKALMANUPDATEWITHPRED Given the output of the measurement prediction
%           step from sqrtKalmanMeasPred and a measurement, complete the
%           measurement update step of the square-root Kalman filter.
%           Separating the measurement prediction step from the rest of the
%           update step can make the creation of multiple measurement
%           association hypotheses from a single target prediction more
%           efficient. The full measurement update function is
%           sqrtKalmanUpdate.
%
%INPUTS: z The zDimX1 measurement vector.
%       SR The zDimXzDim lower-triangular square root of the measurement
%          covariance matrix in the native coordinate system of the
%          measurement.
% otherInfo The intermediate results returned in the otherInfo output of
%          the sqrtKalmanMeasPred function.
%
%OUTPUTS: xUpdate The xDimXnumComp updated state vectors.
%         SUpdate The updated xDimXxDimXnumComp lower-triangular square-
%                 root state covariance matrices.
%      innov, Szz The zDimXnumComp innovations and the zDimXzDimXnumComp
%                 square-root innovation covariance matrix are returned in
%                 case one wishes to analyze the consistency of the
%                 estimator or use those values in gating or likelihood
%                 evaluation.
%               W The xDimXzDimXnumComp gain used in the update. This can
%                 be useful when gating and using the function
%                 calcMissedGateCov.
%
%See the comments to the function sqrtKalmanMeasPred for an example of
%usage of this function. See the comments to sqrtKalmanUpdate for more
%information on the algorithm.

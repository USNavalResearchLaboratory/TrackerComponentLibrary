function [xUpdate,LUpdate,PUpdate,innov,Pzz,W]=separatedCovUpdateWithPred(z,R,otherInfo,LPred,c)
%%SEPARATEDCOVUPDATEWITHPRED Given the output of the measurement prediction
%           step from separatedCovMeasPred and a measurement, complete the
%           measurement update step of the separated covariance filter.
%           Separating the measurement prediction step from the rest of the
%           update step can make the creation of multiple measurement
%           association hypotheses from a single target prediction more
%           efficient. The full measurement update function is
%           separatedCovUpdate.
%
%INPUTS: z The zDimX1 vector measurement.
%        R The zDimXzDim measurement covariance matrix in the native
%          coordinate system of the measurement.
% otherInfo The intermediate results returned in the otherInfo output of
%          the separatedCovMeasPred function.
%    LPred The xDimXzDimXnumComp predicted delay vectors (defined before
%          Equation 12 in [1]). The use of multiple columns represents a
%          choice in how the algorithm was generalized to multiple
%          dimensions.
%        c The confidence region under consideration by the filter. 0<c<1.
%          If this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the
%          default value of c=0.99 is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: xUpdate The xDimXnumComp updated state vectors.
%         LUpdate The xDimXzDimXnumComp updated delay vectors.
%         PUpdate The xDimXxDimXnumComp covariance matrices of the state
%                 estimates. This is a combination of LUpdate and PUpdate.
%      innov, Pzz The zDimXnumComp innovations and a zDimXzDimXnumComp
%                 set of matrices Pzz that are akin to an innovation
%                 covariance matrices are returned in case one wishes to
%                 analyze the consistency of the estimator or use those
%                 values in gating or likelihood evaluation.
%               W The xDimXzDimXnumComp gains used in the update.
%
%See the comments to the function separatedCovMeasPred for an example of
%usage of this function. See the comments to separatedCovUpdate for more
%information on the algorithm.

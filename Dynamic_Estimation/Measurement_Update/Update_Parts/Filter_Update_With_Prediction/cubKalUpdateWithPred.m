function [xUpdate,PUpdate,innov,Pzz,W]=cubKalUpdateWithPred(z,R,otherInfo)
%%CUBKALUPDATEWITHPRED Given the output of the measurement prediction step
%           from cubKalMeasPred and a measurement, complete the measurement
%           update step of the cubature Kalman filter with additive
%           measurement noise. Separating the measurement prediction step
%           from the rest of the update step can make the creation of
%           multiple measurement association hypotheses from a single
%           target prediction more efficient. The full measurement update
%           function is cubKalUpdate.
%
%INPUTS:  z The zDimX1 measurement vector.
%         R The zDimXzDim measurement covariance matrix in the native
%           coordinate system of the measurement.
% otherInfo The intermediate results returned in the otherInfo output of
%           the cubKalMeasPred function.
%
%OUTPUTS: xUpdate The xDimXnumComp updated state vectors.
%         PUpdate The updated xDimXxDimXnumComp state covariance matrices.
%      innov, Pzz The zDimXnumComp innovations and the zDimXzDimXnumComp
%                 innovation covariance matrices are returned in case one
%                 wishes to analyze the consistency of the estimator or use
%                 those values in gating or likelihood evaluation.
%               W The xDimXzDimXnumComp gains used in the update.
%
%See the comments to the function cubKalMeasPred for an example of usage of
%this function. See the comments to cubKalUpdate for more information on
%the algorithm.

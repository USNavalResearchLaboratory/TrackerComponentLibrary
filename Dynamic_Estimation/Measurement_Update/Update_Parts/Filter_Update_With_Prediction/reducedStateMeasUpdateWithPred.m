function [xUpdate,MUpdate,DUpdate,innov,Pzz,W]=reducedStateMeasUpdateWithPred(z,R,otherInfo,MPred,DPred)
%%REDUCEDSTATEMEASUPDATEWITHPRED Given the output of the measurement
%           prediction step from reducedStateMeasPred and a measurement,
%           complete the measurement update step of the reduced state
%           estimator. Separating the measurement prediction step from the
%           rest of the update step can make the creation of multiple
%           measurement association hypotheses from a single target
%           prediction more efficient. The full measurement update function
%           is reducedStateUpdate.
%
%INPUTS: z The zDimX1 vector measurement.
%        R The zDimXzDim measurement covariance matrix in the native
%          coordinate system of the measurement.
% otherInfo The intermediate results returned in the otherInfo output of
%          the KalmanMeasPred function.
%    MPred The xDimXxDimXnumComp matrices contributing to the total
%          predicted state covariance matrix based solely on measurement
%          errors.
%    DPred The xDimXzDimXnumComp matrices of bias coefficients that are
%          supposed to relate target state errors to dynamic model
%          parameter uncertainty.
%
%OUTPUTS: xUpdate The xDimXnumComp updated state estimates.
%         MUpdate The xDimXxDimXnumComp updated state covariance matrices
%                 contribution due to measurement errors.
%         DUpdate The xDimXzDimXnumComp matrices of updated bias
%                 coefficients contributing to the state covariance matrix.
%      innov, Pzz The zDimXnumComp innovations and a zDimXzDimXnumComp set
%                 of matrices matrix Pzz that are akin to an innovation
%                 covariance matrices are returned in case one wishes to
%                 analyze the consistency of the estimator or use those
%                 values in gating or likelihood evaluation.
%               W The xDimXzDimXnumComp gains used in the updates. This can
%                 be useful when gating and using the function
%                 calcMissedGateCov.

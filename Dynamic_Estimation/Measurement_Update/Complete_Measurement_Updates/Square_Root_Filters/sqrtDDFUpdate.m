function [xUpdate,SUpdate,innov,Szz,W]=sqrtDDFUpdate(xPred,SPred,z,SR,h,algorithm,innovTrans)
%%SQRTDDFUPDATE Perform the measurement update step in the square-root
%               version of the central difference filter (CDF), or the
%               first or second order divided difference filter (DDF) with
%               additive measurement noise.
%
%INPUTS: xPred The xDim X 1 predicted target state.
%        SPred The xDim X xDim lower-triangular predicted state covariance
%              matrix.
%            z The zDim X 1 vector measurement.
%           SR The zDim X zDim lower-triangular square root of the
%              measurement covariance matrix in the native coordinate
%              system of the measurement.
%            h A function handle for the measurement function that takes
%              the state as its argument.
%    algorithm An optional parameter specifying which algorithm should be
%              used for the prediction. Possible values are:
%              0 Use the CDF of [3]. This is actually the same as a first-
%                order DDF of [1] and [2], but with a different step size
%                for the finite differences.
%              1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use
%                the first-order divided difference filter of [1] and [2].
%              2 Use the second-order divided difference filter of [1] and
%                [2].
%   innovTrans An optional function handle that computes and optionally
%              transforms the value of the difference between the
%              observation and any predicted points. This is called as
%              innovTrans(a,b) and the default if omitted or an empty
%              matrix is passed is @(a,b)bsxfun(@minus,a,b). This must be
%              able to handle sets of values. For a zDimX1 measurement,
%              either of the inputs could be zDimXN in size while one of
%              the inputs could be zDimX1 in size.  This only needs to be
%              supplied when a measurement difference must be restricted
%              to a certain range. For example, the innovation between two
%              angles will be 2*pi if one angle is zero and the other
%              2*pi, even though they are the same direction. In such an
%              instance, a function handle to the
%              wrapRange(bsxfun(@minus,a,b),-pi,pi) function with the
%              appropriate parameters should be passed for innovTrans.
%
%OUTPUTS: xUpdate The xDim X 1 updated state vector.
%         SUpdate The updated xDim X xDim lower-triangular square root
%                 state covariance matrix.
%      innov, Szz The zDimX1 innovation and the zDimXzDim square root
%                 innovation covariance matrix are returned in case one
%                 wishes to analyze the consistency of the estimator or use
%                 those values in gating or likelihood evaluation.
%               W The xDimXzDim gain used in the update. This can be
%                 useful when gating and using the function
%                 calcMissedGateCov.
%
%The divided difference filters are implemented as described in [1] and
%[2], where they are only derived for non-additive noise and the square
%root form is the most natural form to use. The extension to additive noise
%comes by realizing that the first moment with respect to the additive
%measurement noise is just the square root of the covariance matrix and the
%second moment is zero. The central difference filter of [3] is the same as
%a first-order divided difference filter, but using a different distance
%for the finite differences.
%
%The optional parameter innovTrans is not described in references [1]-[3]
%above reference, but allow for possible modifications to the filter as
%described in [4] The parameter has been added to allow the filter to be
%used with angular quantities. For example, if the measurement consisted of
%range and angle, z=[r;theta], then
%innovTrans=@(a,b)[bsxfun(@minus,a(1,:),b(1,:));
%                  wrapRange(bsxfun(@minus,a(2,:),b(2,:)),-pi,pi)];
%should be used to approximately deal with the circular nature of the
%measurements.

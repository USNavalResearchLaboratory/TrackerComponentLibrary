function [xi,xUpdate,PUpdate,Pzz,innovPoints]=purePropUpdate(xi,w,z,R,h,innovTrans,measAvgFun,stateDiffTrans,stateTrans)
%%PUREPROPUPDATE Perform the measurement update step of a pure propagation
%                (cubature) filter. Such a filter is similar to a cubature
%                (unscented) Kalman filter in that cubature points are
%                updated, but differs in that differs in that the
%                points are never resampled from the first two moments.
%                The input and primary output of this function is a set
%                of cubature points. Thus, information on higher order
%                moments is, to an extent, preserved. The filter updates
%                the points, which can then be given to the propagation
%                function. The first two moments (mean and covariance) are
%                also available for display, but do not directly play a
%                role in the filter.
%
%INPUTS: xi An xDim X numCubPoints matrix of sample (cubature) points that
%           are to be propagated. These are akin to target state
%           hypotheses.
%         w A numCubPoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with the
%           sample points. These are not changed during the propagation of
%           the points.
%         z The zDim X 1 vector measurement.
%         R The zDim X zDim measurement covariance matrix.
%         h A function handle for the measurement function that takes the
%           state as its argument.
% innovTrans An optional function handle that computes and optionally
%           transforms the value of the difference between the observation
%           and any predicted points. This is called as innovTrans(a,b) and
%           the default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed is
%           @(a,b)bsxfun(@minus,a,b). This must be able to handle sets of
%           values. For a zDimX1 measurement, either of the inputs could be
%           zDimXN in size while one of the inputs could be zDimX1 in size.
%           This only needs to be supplied when a measurement difference
%           must be restricted to a certain range. For example, the
%           innovation between two angles will be 2*pi if one angle is zero
%           and the other 2*pi, even though they are the same direction. In
%           such an instance, a function handle to the
%           wrapRange(bsxfun(@minus,a,b),-pi,pi) function with the
%           appropriate parameters should be passed for innovTrans.
% measAvgFun An optional function handle that, when given N measurement
%           values with weights, produces the weighted average. This
%           function only has to be provided if the domain of the
%           measurement is not linear. For example, when averaging angular
%           values, then the function meanAng should be used.
% stateDiffTrans An optional function handle that takes an xDimXN matrix of
%           N differences between states and transforms them however might
%           be necessary. For example, a state containing angular
%           components will generally need to be transformed so that the
%           difference between the angles is wrapped to -pi/pi.
% stateTrans An optional function that takes a matrix of N state estimates
%           and transforms them. This is useful if one wishes the elements
%           of the state to be bound to a certain domain. For example, if
%           an element of the state is an angle, one might generally want
%           to bind it to the region +/-pi.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi The xDim X numCubPoints matrix of updated sample points. w
%            is still the associated set of weights.
%    xUpdate The weighed mean of the updated sample points.
%    PUpdate The covariance matrix associated with the updated sample
%            points.
% Pzz, innovPoints The zDimXzDim innovation covariance matrix and the
%            zDimXnumCubPoints innovation value for each of the points are
%            returned in case one wishes to analyze the consistency of the
%            estimator or use those values in gating or likelihood
%            evaluation. One will typically use the average of innovPoints
%            over all of the cubature points.
%
%The algorithm is based on that of [1], but in [1], the sigma-point
%covariance increase method is specifically tailored for the points used in
%a standard unscented Kalman filter. We would prefer to use a completely
%arbitrary set of cubature points. We could create a similar contiuous-time
%Riccatti equation to transform
%Pxx=sum_i w(i)*xiBar(i)*xiBar(i)'
%into
%Pxx+Q=sum_i w(i)*(xiBar(i)+U(i))*(xiBar(i)+U(i))'
%for an arbitrary set of points, where xiBar(i)=xi(i)-xiBar, where xiBar is
%the weighted average of the cubature points. However, how one chooses the
%points U(i) will warp the higher moments in different ways. However, one
%would expect that all points should be equally affected. Thus, we choose
%to scale the points about the mean instead. If Pxx is positive definite,
%then there should be a solution.
%
%Basically, we want to find a lower-triangular matrix C such that
%C*P*C'=P+Q
%Say P=SP*SP' and P+Q=SPQ*SPQ', where SP and SPQ can be found via Cholesky
%decompositions. Then, C*SP*SP'*C'=SPQ*SPQ'. Thus, if we say that C*SP=SPQ,
%then C=SPQ*inv(SP). We then replace xi(i) with C*(xi(i)-xiBar)+xiBar. The
%pinv function and the cholSemiDef function are used to help lessen
%problems with nearly singular matrices.
%
%The optional parameters innovTrans and measAvgFun are not described in the
%above reference, but allow for possible modifications to the filter as
%described in [2]. The parameters have been added to allow the filter to be
%used with angular quantities. For example, if the measurement consisted of
%range and angle, z=[r;theta], then
%innovTrans=@(a,b)[bsxfun(@minus,a(1,:),b(1,:));
%                  wrapRange(bsxfun(@minus,a(2,:),b(2,:)),-pi,pi)];
%measAvgFun=@(z,w)[calcMixtureMoments(z(1,:),w);
%                  meanAng(z(2,:),w')];
%should be used to approximately deal with the circular nature of the
%measurements.

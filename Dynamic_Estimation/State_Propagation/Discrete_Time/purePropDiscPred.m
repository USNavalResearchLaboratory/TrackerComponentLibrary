function [xi,xPred,PPred]=purePropDiscPred(xi,w,f,Q,stateDiffTrans,stateTrans)
%%PUREPROPDISCPRED Perform the state prediction step of a discrete-time
%                  pure propagation (cubature) filter. Such a filter is
%                  similar to a cubature (unscented) Kalman filter in that
%                  cubature points are propagated, but differs in that the
%                  points are never resampled from the first two moments.
%                  The input and primary output of this function is a set
%                  of cubature points. Thus, information on higher order
%                  moments is, to an extent, preserved. The filter 
%                  propagates the points, which can then be provided to the
%                  measurement update function. The first two moments (mean
%                  and covariance) are also available for display, but do
%                  not directly play a role in the filter.
%
%INPUTS: xi An xDim X numCubPoints matrix of sample (cubature) points that
%           are to be propagated. These are akin to target state
%           hypotheses.
%         w A numCubPoints X 1 vector of the weights associated with the
%           sample points. These are not changed during the propagation of
%           the points.
%         f A function handle for the state transition function that takes
%           the state as its parameter.
%         Q The xDimX xDim process noise covariance matrix for an additive
%           Gaussian process noise model.
% stateDiffTrans An optional function handle that takes an xDimXN matrix
%                of N differences between states estimates and
%                transforms them however might be necessary. For
%                example, a state containing angular components will
%                generally need differences between angular components
%                wrapped to the range +/-pi.
% stateTrans An optional function that takes a state estimate and
%            transforms it. This is useful if one wishes the elements of
%            the state to be bound to a certain domain. For example, if an
%            element of the state is an angle, one should generally want to
%            bind it to the region +/-pi. This is not applied to the output
%            of f.
%
%OUTPUTS: xi The xDim X numCubPoints matrix of propagated sample points. w
%            is still the associated set of weights.
%      xPred The weighed mean of the predicted sample points.
%      PPred The covariance matrix associated with the predicted sample
%            points. If the propagated sample points before adding in the
%            effects of the additive noise were not full rank, then this
%            might not equal the true predicted sample covariance matrix.
%
%A discrete dynamic model of
%x_{k+1}=f(x_{k})+w_k
%where x_k is the state at discrete time k, and x_{k+1} is the state at
%discrete time k+1. w_k is zero-mean additive Gaussian noise is assumed.
%
%The algorithm is based on that of [1], but in [1], the sigma-point
%covariance increase method is specifically tailored for the points used in
%a standard unscented Kalman filter. We would prefer to use a completely
%arbitrary set of cubature points. We could create a similar contiuous-time
%Riccatti equation to transform
%Pxx=sum_i w(i)*xiBar(i)*xiBar(i)'
%into
%Pxx+Q=sum_i w(i)*(xiBar(i)+U(i))*(xiBar(i)+U(i))'
%for an arbitrary set of points, where xiBar(i)=xi(i)-xiBar, where xiBar is
%the weighted average of the cubature points. However, how one chooses the
%points U(i) will warp the higher moments in different ways. However, one
%would expect that all points should be equally affected. Thus, we choose
%to scale the points about the mean instead. If Pxx is positive definite,
%then there should be a solution.
%
%Basically, we want to find a lower-triangular matrix C such that
%C*P*C'=P+Q
%Say P=SP*SP' and P+Q=SPQ*SPQ', where SP and SPQ can be found via Cholesky
%decompositions. Then, C*SP*SP'*C'=SPQ*SPQ'. Thus, if we say that C*SP=SPQ,
%then C=SPQ*inv(SP). We then replace xi(i) with C*(xi(i)-xiBar)+xiBar. The
%pinv function and the cholSemiDef function are used to help lessen
%problems with nearly singular matrices.

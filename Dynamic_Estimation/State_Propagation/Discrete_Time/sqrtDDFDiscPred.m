function [xPred,SPred]=sqrtDDFDiscPred(xPrev,SPrev,f,SQ,algorithm)
%%SQRTDDF2DISCPRED Perform the measurement update step in the square-root
%               version of the central difference filter (CDF), or the
%               first or second order divided difference filter (DDF) with
%               additive process noise.
%
%INPUTS: xPrev The xDim X 1 state estimate at the previous time-step.
%        SPrev The xDim X xDim lower-triangular square root of the state
%              covariance matrix at the previous time-step.
%            f A function handle for the state transition function that
%              takes the state as its parameter.
%           SQ The xDimX xDim lower-triangular square root of the process
%              noise covariance matrix.
%    algorithm An optional parameter specifying which algorithm should be
%              used for the prediction. Possible values are:
%              0 Use the CDF of [3]. This is actually the same as a first-
%                order DDF of [1] and [2], but with a different step size
%                for the finite differences.
%             1 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use
%               the first-order divided difference filter of [1] and [2].
%             2 Use the second-order divided difference filter of [1] and
%               [2].
%
%OUTPUTS: xPred The xDim X 1 predicted state estimate.
%         SPred The xDim X xDim lower-triangular square root of the
%               predicted state covariance estimate.
%
%The divided difference filters are implemented as described in [1] and
%[2], where they are only derived for non-additive noise and the square
%root form is the most natural form to use. The extension to additive noise
%comes by relaizing that the first moment with respect to the additive
%process noise is just the square root of the process noise covariance
%matrix and the second moment is zero. The central difference filter of [3]
%is the same as a first-order divided difference filter, but using a
%different distance for the finite differences.

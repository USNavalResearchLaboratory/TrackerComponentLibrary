function J=FIMPredNoClutter(H,F,R,Q,PD)
%FIMPREDNOCLUTTER Calculate the asymptotic Fisher information matrix before
%                 a measurement update using the information reduction
%                 factor technique for a linear system with a detection
%                 probability less than or equal to 1.
%
%INPUTS: H The zDim X xDim measurement matrix such that H*x+w is the
%          measurement, where x is the state and w is zero-mean Gaussian
%          noise with covariance matrix R.
%        F The xDim X xDim state transition matrix The state at discrete-
%          time k+1 is modeled as F times the state at time k plus zero-
%          mean Gaussian process noise with covariance matrix Q.
%        R The zDim X zDim measurement covariance matrix.
%        Q The xDim X xDim process noise covariance matrix. If this is
%          singular, an iterative solution is used. Otherwise, an
%          explicit algorithm is used. If Q is singular, then the Fischer
%          information matrix must be positive definite or numerical issues
%          will arise.
%       PD The optional detection probability of the target at each scan.
%          If omitted, PD is assumed to be one.
%
%OUTPUTS: J The asymptotic prior Fisher information matrix.
%
%The inverse of the Fisher information matrix for a dynamic system is the 
%posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB). This finds the asymptotic value
%BEFORE a measurement update by predicting forward the posterior FIM from
%FIMPostNoClutter.
%
%This algorithm just takes the posterior FIM and puts it through the
%a recursive step for the FIM without a measurement update.
%For more information on how the function works, see the function 
%FIMPostNoClutter, which cites the papers used to obtain the equations.

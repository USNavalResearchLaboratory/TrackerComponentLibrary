function [P,exitCode]=RiccatiPostNoClutter(H,F,R,Q,PD,RelTol,AbsTol,maxIter)
%%RICCATIPOSTNOCLUTTER Solve the posterior Riccati equation that has been
%                      modified for a probability of detection less
%                      than or equal to 1. This provides the average 
%                      asymptotic covariance of a linear Kalman filter with
%                      linear measurements just after a (possible with
%                      probability PD) measurement update.
%
%INPUTS: H The zDim X xDim measurement matrix such that H*x+w is the
%          measurement, where x is the state and w is zero-mean Gaussian
%          noise with covariance matrix R.
%        F The xDim X xDim state transition matrix The state at discrete-
%          time k+1 is modeled as F times the state at time k plus zero-
%          mean Gaussian process noise with covariance matrix Q.
%        R The zDim X zDim measurement covariance matrix.
%        Q The xDim X xDim process noise covariance matrix. This can not be
%          a singular matrix.
%       PD The optional detection probability of the target at each scan.
%          If omitted, PD is assumed to be one.
%   RelTol The maximum relative error tolerance allowed, a positive scalar.
%          This tolerance applies to all elements in the matrix and is only
%          needed if PD<1. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the
%          default value of 1e-13 is used.
%   AbsTol The absolute error tolerance allowed, a positive scalar. This
%          tolerance applies to all elements in the matrix and is only
%          needed if PD<1. If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the
%          default value of 1e-10 is used.
%  maxIter An optional integer specifying the maximum number of iterations.
%          If omitted or an empty matrix is passed, the default is 5000.
%
%OUTPUTS: P The average asymptotic error covariance matrix of the linear
%           Kalman filter with a probability of detection of PD after a
%           (possible) measurement update.
%  exitCode This is zero if convergence is achieved and 1 if it is not
%           achieved.
%
%The notion of a Riccati equation with a detection probability less than
%one is discussed in [1]. However, they do not explicitly write out the
%posterior form. The posterior recursion goes from P_{k|k} to P_{k+1|k+1}.
%This stands in contrast to the prior Riccati equation, which expresses the
%transition from P_{k|k-1} to P_{k+1|k}.
%
%The posterior Riccati equation is
%P=F*P*F'+Q-PD*(F*P*F'*H'+Q*H')*inv(H*F*P*F'*H'+H*Q*H'+R)*(F*P*F'*H'+Q*H')'
%and is derived by substituting the prediction step into the measurement
%update step of the linear Kalman filter with additive process noise and
%additive measurement noise.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% T=1;
% F=FPolyKal(T,6,1);
% q0=1;
% Q=QPolyKal(T,6,1,q0);
% R=diag([10;10;10]);
% H=[1,0,0,0,0,0;
%    0,1,0,0,0,0;
%    0,0,1,0,0,0];
% PD=0.5;
% P=RiccatiPostNoClutter(H,F,R,Q,PD)

function [Pc,PInv]=trackPurityLinApprox(beta,H,F,R,Q,K,PInvInit)
%%TRACKPURITYLINAPPROX Approximate the average track purity and the final
%               track accuracy of a typical track in a cluster of closely-
%               spaced targets. it is assumed that the detection
%               probability is 100% and there are no false alarms. Track
%               purity is the probability that a measurement assigned to a
%               track is actually should be assigned to that track. Average
%               track purity is the average purity over a batch. Here, the
%               batch is taken to be the average purity from the time the
%               system is switched on going for K steps. This function
%               assumes linear dynamic and measurement models.
%
%INPUTS: beta The number of targets per unit volume in the coordinate
%             system of the measurements.
%           H The zDim X xDim measurement matrix such that H*x+w is the
%             measurement, where x is the state and w is zero-mean Gaussian
%             noise with covariance matrix R.
%           F The xDim X xDim state transition matrix The state at
%             discrete-time k+1 is modeled as F times the state at time k
%             plus zero-mean Gaussian process noise with covariance matrix
%             Q.
%           R The zDim X zDim measurement covariance matrix.
%           Q The xDim X xDim process noise covariance matrix. This can not
%             be a singular matrix.
%           K The number of scans (after the initial turn-on) over which
%             one assumes the tracker is run and over which the average
%             purity should be computed.
%    PInvInit This is an initial xDimXxDim inverse covariance matrix for
%             the tracks. One might set this to the inverse covariance
%             matrix one might use for single-point track intiation. One-
%             point differencing is discussed in [3] and Chapter 3.2.2 of
%             [4]. For example, one could use a diagonal matrix with zeros
%             for the position components and a variance for the other
%             (velocity etc.) components that makes the gate fit the
%             assumed maximum speed of a target.
%
%OUTPUTS: Pc The approximate average probability over time that a
%            particular track will have false assignments. This is the same
%            for all tracks.
%       PInv The inverse of the average target covariance matrix (which
%            would provide a figure of track accuracy) at time K (the
%            initial step is time 0) taking into account false
%            associations.  
%
%This function implements the algorithm of Section II of [1], with changes.
%Equation 5 of the model omits process noise. Rather than using Equation 5,
%information filter prediction and update routines from the flow chart in
%Appendix H of [2] are used to propagate the inverse covariance matrix. The
%necessary innovation covariance needed in the equations is just part of a
%standard Kalman filter and can be discered from [2].
%
%EXAMPLE:
% T=1/2;
% F=FPolyKal(T,6,1);
% q0=1;
% Q=QPolyKal(T,6,1,q0);
% R=diag([100;100;100]).^2;
% H=[1,0,0,0,0,0;
%    0,1,0,0,0,0;
%    0,0,1,0,0,0];
% K=5;%5 steps after the initial scan.
% beta=(1/1e3)^3;%1 target every square kilometer.
% PInvInit=diag([0;0;0;1/600^2;1/600^2;1/600^2]);
% [Pc,PInv]=trackPurityLinApprox(beta,H,F,R,Q,K,PInvInit)
% %One will get around a 65.77% average track purity figure.

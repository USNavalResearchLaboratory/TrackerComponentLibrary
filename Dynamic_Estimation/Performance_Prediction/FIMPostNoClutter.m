function J=FIMPostNoClutter(H,F,R,Q,PD)
%FIMPOSTNOCLUTTER Calculate the asymptotic Fisher information matrix after
%                 a measurement update using the information reduction
%                 factor technique for a linear system with a detection
%                 probability less than or equal to 1.
%
%INPUTS: H The zDim X xDim measurement matrix such that H*x+w is the
%          measurement, where x is the state and w is zero-mean Gaussian
%          noise with covariance matrix R.
%        F The xDim X xDim state transition matrix The state at discrete-
%          time k+1 is modeled as F times the state at time k plus zero-
%          mean Gaussian process noise with covariance matrix Q.
%        R The zDim X zDim measurement covariance matrix. This must be
%          positive definite.
%        Q The xDim X xDim process noise covariance matrix. If this is
%          singular, an iterative solution is used. Otherwise, an explicit
%          algorithm is used. If Q is singular, then the Fischer
%          information matrix must be positive definite or numerical issues
%          will arise.
%       PD The optional detection probability of the target at each scan.
%          If omitted, PD is assumed to be one.
%
%OUTPUTS: J The asymptotic posterior Fisher information matrix.
%
%The inverse of the Fisher information matrix for a dynamic system is the 
%posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB). This finds the asymptotic value
%AFTER a measurement update. For the asymptotic value BEFORE  a measurement
%update, see FIMPredNoClutter.
%
%The algorithm is from [1], which simplifies the algorithm of [2] when
%using correlated measurements. The implementation here is for the
%case where there is no clutter. As given in Section 3.2 of [3], the
%information reduction factor for PD<1 without clutter just reduces to PD.
%
%This solves for the Fischer information matrix by solving the Riccati
%equation since in Equation 49 in [4]. It is shown how the basic recursion
%can be rewritten as a Riccati equation that can be solved in a standard
%manner.
%
%If PD=1, the inverse of the FIM  is the same as the output of
%RiccatiPostNoClutter. Otherwise, the inverse FIM is less than the output
%of RiccatiPostNoClutter.

% T=1;
% F=FPolyKal(T,6,1);
% q0=1;

%%BATCHLSLINMEASLINDYN Perform batch least squares state estimation under a
%                linear measurement model and a linear dynamic model with
%                optional process noise.
%
%INPUTS: z The zDim X N matrix of measurements for the whole batch. It is
%          assumed that the measurements have the same dimensionality over
%          the batch. If an empty matrix is passed, then it is assumed that
%          the user only wants the covariance matrix and not xEst. 
%        H The zDim X xDim X N hypermatrix of measurement matrices such
%          that H(:,:,k)*x+w is the measurement at time k, where x is the
%          state and w is zero-mean Gaussian noise with covariance matrix
%          R(:,:,k). Alternatively, if all of the measurement matrices are
%          the same, one can just pass a single zDim X xDim matrix.
%        F An xDim X xDim X (N-1) hypermatrix of  matrices. The state at
%          discrete-time k+1 is modeled as F(:,:,k) times the state at time
%          k plus zero-mean Gaussian process noise with covariance matrix
%          Q(:,:,k). Alternatively, if all of the state transition matrices
%          are the same, one can just pass a single xDim X xDim matrix.
%          Note that all of the F matrices must be invertible if kD is not
%          equal to one.
%        R The zDim X zDim X N hypermatrix of measurement covariance
%          matrices. Alternatively, if all of the measurement covariance
%          matrices are the same, one can just pass a single zDimXzDim
%          matrix.
%       kD The discrete time-step for which the covariance matrix of an
%          estimate is desired, where z(:,1) is at discrete time-step 1
%          (not 0).
%        Q The xDim X xDim X (N-1) hypermatrix of process noise covariance
%          matrices. Alternatively, if all of the process noise covariance
%          matrices are the same, one can just pass a single xDimXxDim
%          matrix. If an empty matrix is passed for Q, then the estimation
%          is performed assuming there is no process noise.
%  numMeas If an empty matrix is passed for z, then the numMeas parameter
%          must be passed indicating the number of measurements in the
%          batch. Otherwise, this parameter is
%                ignored.
%
%OUTPUTS: xEst The batch state estimate at step kD, unless an empty matrix
%              was passed for z, in which case xEst is empty.
%         PEst A covariance matrix estimate that goes with the state
%              estimate.
%
%The algorithm is an implementation of the method of Section 3.3.2 of [1]
%for a linear dynamic model. Note that the cases in equation 28 to 32 of
%the paper did not cover all of the possibilities, so the correct
%generalization had to be derived from E[epsilon_{p,k}*epsilon_{q,k}'].

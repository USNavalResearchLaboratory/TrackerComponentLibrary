function [tuples,gain]=assign2DFreeCol(C,maximize)
%%ASSIGN2DFREECOL Solve the two-dimensional assignment problem where the
%          binary constraints on the columns have been removed. That is,
%          minimize (or maximize)
%          \sum_{i=1}^{numRow}\sum_{j=1}^{numCol}C_{i,j}*x_{i,j}
%          subject to 
%          \sum_{j=1}^{numCol}x_{i,j} =1 for all i
%          x_{i,j}=0 or 1
%          This problem is just a naive nearest neighbor assignment; one
%          simply assigns each row to the column with the smallest (or
%          largest) value.
%
%INPUTS: C A numRowXnumCol cost matrix that does not contain any NaNs.
% maximize If true, the minimization problem is transformed into a
%          maximization problem. The default if this parameter is omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: tuples A 2XnumRow set of assignment values. This is ordered
%                [rowIndex;columnIndex].
%          gain This is the value of the cost. This is the sum of the
%               values in C corresponding to the tuples.

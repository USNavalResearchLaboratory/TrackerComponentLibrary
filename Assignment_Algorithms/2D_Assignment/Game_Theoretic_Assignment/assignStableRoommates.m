function partners=assignStableRoommates(prefLists)
%%ASSIGNSTABLEROOMMATES Solve the basic form of the stable roommates 
%        problem. In this problem, an even number of individuals rank their
%        preferences for each other. The algorithm then finds a stable 
%        pairing of individuals, if one exists. An assignment is stable if
%        there is no pair of (non-assigned) members where BOTH prefer each 
%        other over their current assignment. This function finds one
%        solutions; though multiple solutions may exist. If no solutions
%        exist, an empty matrix is returned.
%
%INPUTS: prefLists An NX(N-1) matrix where prefLists(n,i) is the ith
%                  preferred roommate for person n. N must be an even
%                  number. The "roommate" is just a number from 1 to N that
%                  cannot equal n. Alternatively, an NXN matrix can be
%                  passed, where the last column is equal to the row
%                  number. This is allowed as this algorithm just augments
%                  any NX(N-1) matrix to have that format before proceeding
%                  (it plays a role in identifying infeasible assignments).
%
%OUTPUTS: partners An NX1 vector listing which each partner of the N
%                  individuals is assigned to share a room in a stable
%                  assignment (thus, partners is a permutation vector). If
%                  no stable assignment exists, then an empty matrix is
%                  returned.
%
%The O(N^2) algorithm of [1] is used to solve the problem.
%   
%Example with a solution (from [1]):
% prefLists=[4,6,2,5,3;
%            6,3,5,1,4;
%            4,5,1,6,2;
%            2,6,5,1,3;
%            4,2,3,6,1;
%            5,1,4,2,3];
% partners=assignStableRoommates(prefLists)
%The solution should be partners=[6;3;2;5;4;1] for pairs of (1,6), (2,3),
%and (4,5)
%
%Example without a solution (from [1]):
% prefLists=[2,6,4,3,5;
%            3,5,1,6,4;
%            1,6,2,5,4;
%            5,2,3,6,1;
%            6,1,3,4,2;
%            4,2,5,1,3];
% partners=assignStableRoommates(prefLists)
%The solution in this instance is an empty matrix, because no stable
%solution exists.
%   
%Example with multiple solutions (from [1]). Only 1 solution is found by
%this function, though.
% prefLists=[2,5,4,6,7,8,3;
%            3,6,1,7,8,5,4;
%            4,7,2,8,5,6,1;
%            1,8,3,5,6,7,2;
%            6,1,8,2,3,4,7;
%            7,2,5,3,4,1,8;
%            8,3,6,4,1,2,5;
%            5,4,7,1,2,3,6];
% partners=assignStableRoommates(prefLists)
%The solution that will be found by this algorithm is
%partners=[4;3;2;1;6;5;8;7]. However, the other two possible solutions are
%[1,2,3,4,8,7,6,5] and [5,6,7,8,1,2,3,4].

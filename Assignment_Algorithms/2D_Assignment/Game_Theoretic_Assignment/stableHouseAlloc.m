function [house4Agent,agent4House]=stableHouseAlloc(prefLists,houseList)
%%STABLEHOUSEALLOC This solves the stable house allocation problem with
%                  seniority. Given a set of agents who rank a collection
%                  of houses, we want to find a stable allocation of houses
%                  to agents. That is, no pair of agents would both prefer
%                  to swap houses versus keeping the one they are in.
%                  However, the notion of seniority comes in when an agent
%                  has a house and wants to trade up. In such an instance,
%                  the same type of assignment will take place, but where
%                  the agents with seniority are guaranteed not to house a
%                  house they rank lower than the current one they are
%                  occupying. This is a type of 2D assignment problem.
%                  
%INPUTS: prefLists A numAgentsXnumPrefs list of where
%                  prefLists(curAgent,curRank) is the number of the house
%                  (starting from 0) ranked in position curRank by the
%                  agent. Agents do not have to rank all houses. However,
%                  unranked houses are assumed to be undesired and agents
%                  not raking enough houses can be left without a house
%                  despite availability. All agents must rank at least one
%                  house. If agents do not all rank the same number of
%                  houses, all houses after the number ranked by the agent
%                  must be set to zero. Houses are specified by index
%                  starting from 1 to numHouses.
%        houseList A numHousesX1 or 1XnumHouses vector where
%                  houseList(numHouse) is the index of the agent currently
%                  residing in the house (and thus posessing seniority so
%                  that he is guaranteed not to get a house worse than his
%                  current house). Unoccupied houses are set to 0.
%
%OUTPUTS: house4Agent A numAgentsX1 vector where house4Agent(curAgent) is
%                     the index of the house to which the agent is
%                     assigned, and 0 otherwise.
%         agent4House A numHousesX1 vector where agent4House(curHouse)
%                     provides the index of the agent assigned to the house
%                     or 0 if the house is unassgined.
%
%This implements the top trading cycles algorithm as described in [1]. The
%algorithm has been slightly modified to handle preference lists of
%different lengths.
%
%Example from [1]:
% prefLists=[2,6,5,1,4,3,7;
%            7,1,6,5,4,3,2;
%            2,1,4,7,3,6,5;
%            2,4,3,6,1,7,5;
%            4,3,7,1,2,5,6];
% houseList=[1;
%            2;
%            3;
%            4;
%            0;
%            0;
%            0];
% [house4Agent,agent4House]=stableHouseAlloc(prefLists,houseList)
%And the optimal assignment of houses to agents is house4Agent=[2;7;1;4;3]
%
%Consider an example where there are not enough houses. In such an
%instance, we can see those with seniority getting preference:
% prefLists=[1,2,3,4;
%            2,3,4,1;
%            4,3,2,1;
%            1,2,3,4;
%            3,1,2,4];
% houseList=[1;3;2;4];
% [house4Agent,agent4House]=stableHouseAlloc(prefLists,houseList)
%Here, the stable assignment is house4Agent=[1;3;4;2;0]; The last agent
%cound not get a house, because he did not already have seniority.
%
%The effects of seniority can be seen with two more example using the same
%prefLists as above:
% houseList=[2;3;0;1];
% [house4Agent1,agent4House1]=stableHouseAlloc(prefLists,houseList)
% houseList=[2;3;5;1];
% [house4Agent2,agent4House2]=stableHouseAlloc(prefLists,houseList)
%In the first example, the stable assignment is house4Agent1=[1;2;4;3;0],
%leaving the last agent out again. However, in the second example, the
%stable assignment is house4Agent =[1;2;4;0;3]; as the last agent has
%seniority and cannot be booted out.
%
%The algorithm can also handle short preference lists, which might leave
%extra agents unassigned. In the previous case:
% prefLists=[1,2,3;
%            2,3,4;
%            4,3,2;
%            1,2,3;
%            3,1,2];
% houseList=[1;3;2;4];
% [house4Agent,agent4House]=stableHouseAlloc(prefLists,houseList)
%Here, we get an assignment of house4Agent=[1;3;4;2;0], which is the same
%as before. However, if we make the preference lists too short and they are
%bit conflicting, then some agents who would normally have seniority can
%get stuck with nothing:
% prefLists=[1;
%            2;
%            4;
%            1;
%            1];
% houseList=[1;3;2;4];
% [house4Agent,agent4House]=stableHouseAlloc(prefLists,houseList)
%The stable assignment here is house4Agent=[1;2;4;0]. In this instance,
%there are enough houses, but the last two agents only want house 1, which
%must go to the first agent due to seniority, so they get nothing.

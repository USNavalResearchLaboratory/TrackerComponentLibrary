function [tuples,gain,u,v]=assign2DFull(C,maximize,algorithm)
%%ASSIGN2DFULL This functions performs the type of 2D assignment that often
%       arises as a subproblem when solving an S-dimensional assignment
%       problem for target tracking. The cost function being minimized (or
%       maximized) is
%       \sum_{i=1}^{numRow}\sum_{j=1}^{numCol}C_{i,j}*x_{i,j}
%       subject to
%       \sum_{j=1}^{numCol}x_{i,j}=1 for i=2:numRow
%       \sum_{i=1}^{numRow}x_{i,j}=1 for j=2:numCol
%       x_{i,j}=0 or 1.
%       Note that the first row and the first column can be multiply
%       assigned and every row and every column aside from the first ones
%       must be assigned to exactly one value.
%
%INPUTS: C A (numRow)X(numCol) cost matrix where the first row is the
%          cost of not assigning each column (from number 2) and the first
%          column is the cost of not assigning each row (from number 2) and
%          C(1,1) is an assignment cost that is unconstrained and only
%          assigned if it improves the cost function (given above). The
%          matrix cannot contain any NaNs and if maximizing, cannot
%          contain any Inf values and if minimizing cannot contain any -Inf
%          values. If algorithm=1 is selected, then it is not allowed that
%          both C(2:end,1) and C(1,2:end) contain non-finite terms.
%          However, either one individually can contain non-finite terms.
%          When algorithm=1 and both C(2:end,1) and C(1,2:end) contain non-
%          finite terms, the algorithm will report that the problem is
%          infeasible, because it cannot solve such problems. 
% maximize If true, the minimization problem is transformed into a
%          maximization problem. The default if this parameter is omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed is false.
% algorithm A value selecting which algorithm will be used. The basis for
%          the algorithms are discussed in more detail below. Possible
%          values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Use an
%            algorithm that effectively solves an optimization problem on a
%            (numRow-1)+(numCol-1) augmented matrix, though the matrix is
%            not explicitly formed.
%          1 Use an algorithm that removes the first column and modifies
%            the cost matrix so that the optimization problem can be
%            solved using the assign2DMissedDetect function, which
%            effectively solves a problem on a
%            (numRow+numCol-1)X(numCol-1) augmented matrix. Unlike
%            algorithm 0, this algorithm requires that there not be
%            non-finite terms in both the first row and the first column of
%            C. Otherwise, the problem will be labeled as infeasible.
%
%OUTPUTS: tuples A 2XnumTuples set of assignment values. This is ordered
%               [Row Index;Column Index]. The number of tuples ranges from
%               max(numRow-1,numCol-1), for the case where as many things
%               as possible are not assigned to the uncontrained values and
%               C(1,1) is not assigned, to numRow+numCol-1 for the case
%               where all rows and columns are assigned to the
%               unconstrained hypothesis and C(1,1) is provided. If the
%               problem is infeasible, this is an empty matrix.
%          gain This is the value of the cost. This is the sum of the
%               values in C corresponding to the tuples. If
%               the problem is infeasible, this is -1.
%           u,v These are the dual variables for the constrained columns
%               and for constrained rows of C. These will satisfy the
%               complementary slackness condition of the problem as
%               transformed. The transformation differes dependong on
%               whether algorithm 0 or algorithm 1 is chosen. See the
%               examples below.
%
%Algorithm 0 utilizes the equivalence of the minimization for the problem
%with two unconstrained indices to one with no unconstrained indices. The
%problem described above, removing the C(1,1) element, is equivalent to the
%optimization problem 
%           minimize (or maximize)
%          \sum_{i=1}^{numAug}\sum_{j=1}^{numAug}D_{i,j}*x_{i,j}
%          subject to
%          \sum_{j=1}^{numAug}x_{i,j}=1 for all i
%          \sum_{i=1}^{numAug}x_{i,j}=1 for all j
%          x_{i,j}=0 or 1.
%where the matrix D is a numAugXnumAug matrix with numAug=(numRow+numCol-2)
%that can be formed as follows:
% D=Inf(numAug,numAug);
% D(1:(numRow-1),1:(numCol-1))=C(2:end,2:end);
% D(numRow:totalAug,numCol:totalAug)=0;
% for curRow=1:(numRow-1)
%     missedCol=(numCol-1)+curRow;
%     D(curRow,missedCol)=C(curRow+1,1);
% end
% for curCol=1:(numCol-1)
%     missedRow=(numRow-1)+curCol;
%     D(missedRow,curCol)=C(1,curCol+1);
% end
%Basically, C(2:end,2:end) is an upper-left submatrix. The upper-right and
%lower-left submatrix consist of Inf terms with diagonals that are the
%missed detection costs for the rows and columns. The lower-right submatrix
%is all zeros. This function solves the problem by implementing the 2D
%Jonker-Volgenant algorithm of [1] for the augmented problem, but the
%matrix C itself is never augmented.
%
%Algorithm 1 is based on the fact that since every unconstrained column
%must be assigned, one can subtract the cost of the unconstrained row from
%all columns and then perform regular 2D assignment using
%assign2DMissedDetect. One can subtract it, because an assignment must be
%made for each constrained column. Subtracting the unconstrained row costs
%changes the gain, but it does not change the optimal assignment of the
%contrained columns. We find the optimal column assignment with a standard
%2D assignment algorithm. The unassigned rows then just need to be added
%back in as assigned to the unconstrained hypothesis and the gain must be
%adjusted. In general, the cost matrix will not be all-positive, so a
%constant value is added to it to make all of the elements positive. The
%hypothesis C(1,1) (from the unmodified matrix) is only added in if it
%improves the cost function. If the unconstrained column contains non-
%finite terms, then the matrix is transposed and the transposed problem is
%solved, after which the results are flipped back.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%Here, we verify that the solution equals the solution obtained through
%linear programming.
% numRow=6;
% numCol=8;
% C=2*rand(numRow,numCol)-1;
% c=C(:);
% numEls=length(c);
% 
% %Equality constraints specifying that each constrained column is assigned 
% %assigned to exactly one row.
% AEqC=[zeros(7,6),kron(eye(7),ones(1,6))];
% bEqC=ones(7,1);
% 
% %Equality constraints specifying that each constrained row is assigned to
% %exactly one column.
% AEqR=[[zeros(5,1),eye(5)],kron(ones(1,7),[zeros(5,1),eye(5)])];
% bEqR=ones(5,1);
% 
% A=[AEqC;AEqR];
% b=[bEqC;bEqR];
% 
% %The only inequality constraint that is needed (and is not needed in a
% %normal 2D assignment problem formulated as a linear programming
% %solution) is the extra contraint on the C(1,1) term. We have to
% %explicitly say that
% %x(1)<=1.
% AIneq=[1,zeros(1,numEls-1)];
% bIneq=1;
% 
% %Solving the problem using linear programming.
% [gainLP,xLP]=linProgRevisedSimplex(A,b,AIneq,bIneq,c);
% 
% %Solving the problem using 
% [tuplesTotal,gain]=assign2DFull(C,false);
% 
% numTuples=size(tuplesTotal,2);
% x=zeros(numRow,numCol);
% for curTuple=1:numTuples
%     x(tuplesTotal(1,curTuple),tuplesTotal(2,curTuple))=x(tuplesTotal(1,curTuple),tuplesTotal(2,curTuple))+1; 
% end
% 
% %One finds that both methods produce the same assignment:
% all(x(:)==xLP(:))
% %Also, it can be verified that gainLP equals gain within certain finite
% %precision bounds. Thus, we have shown that the linear programing solution
% %is equivalent to the generalized 2D assignment solution.
%
%EXAMPLE 2:
%Here we demonstrate that the dual variables satisfy the complementary
%slackness condition for transformed versions of C This examples does this
%for algorithm 0. Example 3 shows how the constant offset needed for
%algorithm 4 differs.  If minimization is performed, one subtracts
%minC=min(0,min(C(:))) from C to get the transformed problem for
%complementary slackness; when performing maximization, subtract
%maxC=max(0,max(C(:))). The complementary slackness condition could be
%forced to hold on C by adding minC or maxC to v. The complementary
%slackness condition is described, for example, in [1].
% numRow=50;
% numCol=30;
% C=randn(numRow,numCol);
% minC=min(0,min(C(:)));
% maximize=false;
% algorithm=0;
% [tuples,gain,u,v]=assign2DFull(C,maximize,algorithm);
% slackVal=0;
% for k=1:size(tuples,2)
%     %If assigned to a constrained value.
%     if(tuples(1,k)~=1&&tuples(2,k)~=1)
%         slackVal=slackVal+abs((C(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-minC)*(C(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-minC-v(tuples(1,k)-1)-u(tuples(2,k)-1)));
%     end
% end
% slackVal
% %One will see that slackVal is zero (within finite precision limits),
% %which is what the complementary slackness condition says.
% %Switching to maximization with the same matrix:
% maximize=true;
% maxC=max(0,max(C(:)));
% [tuples,gain,u,v]=assign2DFull(C,maximize,algorithm);
% for k=1:size(tuples,2)
%     %If assigned to a constrained value.
%     if(tuples(1,k)~=1&&tuples(2,k)~=1)
%         slackVal=slackVal+abs((C(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-maxC)*(C(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-maxC-v(tuples(1,k)-1)-u(tuples(2,k)-1)));
%     end
% end
% slackVal
% %slackVal is again zero, within finite precision limits.
%
%EXAMPLE 3:
%This is the same as example 2, except algorithm 1 is used. One can note
%that the constant needed for the complementary slackness condition to hold
%is different and more complicated to compute and is given by the modC term
%below.
% numRow=50;
% numCol=30;
% C=randn(numRow,numCol);
% maximize=false;
% algorithm=1;
% [tuples,gain,u,v]=assign2DFull(C,maximize,algorithm);
% 
% modC=C;
% modC(2:numRow,2:numCol)=bsxfun(@minus,modC(2:numRow,2:numCol),C(2:numRow,1));
% minModC=min(0,min(vec(modC(1:numRow,2:numCol))));
% %We verify the correctness of the complementary slackness condition.
% slackVal=0;
% for k=1:size(tuples,2)
%     %If assigned to a constrained value
%     if(tuples(1,k)~=1&&tuples(2,k)~=1)
%         slackVal=slackVal+abs((C(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-minModC)*(C(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-minModC-v(tuples(1,k)-1)-u(tuples(2,k)-1)));
%     end
% end
% slackVal
% 
% %One will see that slackVal is zero (within finite precision limits),
% %which is what the complementary slackness condition says.
% %Switching to maximization with the same matrix:

function [tuples,gain,u,v]=assign2DFullAlt(C,maximize)
%%ASSIGN2DFULLALT This functions performs the type of 2D assignment that often
%       arises as a subproblem when solving an S-dimensional assignment
%       problem for target tracking. The cost function being minimized (or
%       maximized) is
%       \sum_{i=1}^{numRow}\sum_{j=1}^{numCol}C_{i,j}*x_{i,j}
%       subject to
%       \sum_{j=1}^{numCol}x_{i,j}=1 for i=2:numRow
%       \sum_{i=1}^{numRow}x_{i,j}=1 for j=2:numCol
%       x_{i,j}=0 or 1.
%       Note that the first row and the first column can be multiply
%       assigned and every row and every column aside from the first ones
%       must be assigned to exactly one value.
%
%INPUTS: C A (numRow)X(numCol) cost matrix where the first row is the
%          cost of not assigning each column (from number 2) and the first
%          column is the cost of not assigning each row (from number 2) and
%          C(1,1) is an assignment cost that is unconstrained and only
%          assigned if it improves the cost function (given above). The
%          matrix cannot contain any NaNs and if maximizing, cannot
%          contain any Inf values and if minimizing cannot contain any -Inf
%          values. It is not allowed that both C(2:end,1) and C(1,2:end)
%          contain non-finite terms. However, either one individually can
%          contain non-finite terms.
% maximize If true, the minimization problem is transformed into a
%          maximization problem. The default if this parameter is omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: tuples A 2XnumTuples set of assignment values. This is ordered
%               [Row Index;Column Index]. the number of tuples ranges from
%               max(numRow-1,numCol-1), for the case where as many things as
%               possible are not assigned to the uncontrained values and
%               C(1,1) is not assigned, to numRow+numCol-1 for the case
%               where all rows and columns are assigned to the
%               unconstrained hypothesis and C(1,1) is provided. If the
%               problem is infeasible, this is an empty matrix.
%          gain This is the value of the cost. This is the sum of the
%               values in C corresponding to the tuples. If
%               the problem is infeasible, this is -1.
%           u,v These are the dual variables for the constrained columns
%               and for constrained rows of C. These will satisfy the
%               complementary slackness condition. Note that if the values
%               in C(:,1) are very large, there can be a loss of precision
%               in u and v.
%
%The algorithm is based on the fact that since every unconstrained column
%must be assigned, one can subtract the cost of the unconstrained row from
%all columns and then perform regular 2D assignment using
%assign2DMissedDetect. One can subtract it, because an assignment must be
%made for each constrained column. Subtracting the unconstrained row costs
%changes the gain, but it does not change the optimal assignment of the
%contrained columns. We find the optimal column assignment with a standard
%2D assignment algorithm. The unassigned rows then just need to be added
%back in as assigned to the unconstrained hypothesis and the gain must be
%adjusted. In general, the cost matrix will not be all-positive, so a
%constant value is added to it to make all of the elements positive. The
%hypothesis C(1,1) (from the unmodified matrix) is only added in if it
%improves the cost function. If the unconstrained column contains non-
%finite terms, then the matrix is transposed and the transposed problem is
%solved, after which the results are flipped back.

/**ASSIGN2DC This file contains C language functions implementing a
 *          generalized Jonker-Volgenant shortest path assignment algorithm
 *          to solve the two-dimensional assignment problem with a
 *          rectangular cost matrix C. The function assign2DC (commented
 *          below) can perform cost maximization or minimization with cost
 *          matrices having positive and/or negative elements whereas the
 *          function assign2DCBasic assumes that all elements of C are
 *          positive and that only minimization is performed. See the
 *          comments to the Matlab implementation of assign2D for more
 *          details on the algorithm.

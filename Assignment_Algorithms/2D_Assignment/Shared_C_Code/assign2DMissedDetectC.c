/**ASSIGN2DMISSEDDETECTC This file contains C language functions to solve
 *              the two-dimensional assignment problem common to target
 *              tracking, where, in a tracking context, one row represents
 *              missed detection costs. The function assign2DMissedDetectC
 *              (commented below) can perform cost maximization or
 *              minimization with cost matrices having positive and/or
 *              negative elements whereas the function
 *              assign2DCMissedDetectBasic assumes that all elements of C
 *              are positive and that only minimization is performed. See
 *              the comments to the Matlab implementation of
 *              assign2DMissedDetect for more details on the algorithm.

 *%INPUTS: maximize A boolean value indicating whether maximization is

 *                 This is the sum of the values of the assigned elements

 *                 solution. As with C, the tuples are stored by column.

 *
 *OUTPUTS: The outputs are placed in gain, tuples, u, and v. The return
 *         value of this function is 0 if the problem is feasible (and
 *         gain, tuples, u, and v are valid, and it is 1 if the problem is
 *         infeasible and the values in gain, tuples, u, and v have no

function [tuples,gain,u,v]=assign2DMissedDetect(C,maximize,missedDetectByRow)
%%ASSIGN2DMISSEDDETECT Solve the two-dimensional assignment problem common
%          to target tracking, where, in a tracking context, one row (or
%          column) represents missed detection costs. The problem being
%          solved can be formulated (if missedDetectByRow=true) as
%          minimize (or maximize)
%          \sum_{i=1}^{numMeas+1}\sum_{j=1}^{numTar}C_{i,j}*x_{i,j}
%          subject to
%          \sum_{i=1}^{numMeas+1}x_{i,j}=1 for all j
%          \sum_{j=1}^{numTar}x_{i,j}<=1 for i=2:numMeas
%          x_{i,j}=0 or 1. 
%          where the index i=1 has the costs of assigning a target to a
%          missed detection, so multiple targets can be assigned to a
%          missed detection hypothesis. Measurements are indexed starting
%          at 2.
%
%INPUTS: C A (numMeas+1)XnumTar (or if targetByRow=false, a
%          numTarX(numMeas+1) cost matrix) where the first row (or column
%          if targetByRow=false) is the cost of a missed detection for each
%          target and the subsequent rows (columns) are the costs of
%          assigning a measurement to a target. The matrix cannot contain
%          any NaNs and if maximizing, cannot containing any Inf values and
%          if minimizing cannot contain any -Inf values.
% maximize If true, the minimization problem is transformed into a
%          maximization problem. The default if this parameter is omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed is false.
% missedDetectByRow If this is true, the first row of C is the set of
%          missed detection costs. Otherwise, the first column of C is the
%          set of missed detection costs. The default if this parameter is
%          omitted or an empty matrix is passed is true.
%
%OUTPUTS: tuples A 2XnumTar set of assignment values. If
%               targetsByRow=false (or is omitted), then this is ordered
%               [Measurement Index;Target Index]; Otherwise, the ordering
%               is [Target Index; Measurement Index]. If the problem is
%               infeasible, this is an empty matrix.
%          gain This is the value of the cost. This is the sum of the
%               values in C corresponding to the tuples. If the problem is
%               infeasible, this is -1.
%           u,v These are the dual variables for the constrained columns
%               and for constrained rows of C. These will satisfy the
%               complementary slackness condition of a transformed
%               problem.
%
%This function implements a modified Jonker-Volgenant algorithm as
%described in [1] and [2]. However, unlike the assign2D function, which
%implements the same algorithm for rectangular matrices, this
%implementation modifies the ShortestPath step to allow the multiple
%assignment of targets to the missed detection hypothesis. it is
%implicitely solving an assignment problem with measurement costs augmented
%by a numTarXnumTar matrix of costs of missed detection for each target on
%the diagonal and infinite costs on the off diagonals. This changes how
%indexation is performed in the ShortestPath subroutine in this function
%compared to the assign2D function.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%Here we compare how one can represent a set of measurement assignment
%costs and missed detection values compared to using the assign2D function,
%which requires that one augment the assignment matrix. We also verify that
%the complementary slackness condition of the dual for optimality. The
%complementary slackness condition could be forced to hold on C by
%adding minC=min(0,min(C(:))) (during minimization) or
%maxC=max(0,max(C(:))) (during maximization) to v. As it is, the
%complementary slackness condition holds on C-minC for minimization and
%C-maxC for maximization (mentioned in [1]) is satisfied.
% numTar=10;
% numMeas=20;
% maximize=false;
% C=2*rand(numMeas,numTar)-1;
% missedDetect=2*rand(1,numTar)-1;
% C1=[missedDetect;C];
% minC1=min(0,min(C1(:)));
% missedDetectByRow=true;
% [tuples,gain,u,v]=assign2DMissedDetect(C1,maximize,missedDetectByRow);
% 
% %We verify the correctness of the complementary slackness condition.
% slackVal=0;
% for k=1:numTar
%     %If assigned to a constrained value
%     if(tuples(1,k)~=1&&tuples(2,k)~=1)
%         slackVal=slackVal+abs((C1(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-minC1)*(C1(tuples(1,k),tuples(2,k))-minC1-v(tuples(1,k)-1)-u(tuples(2,k))));
%     end
% end
% slackVal
% %One will see that the slack value is zero, indicating that the
% %complementary slackness condition is satisfied. Note that this is on the
% %problem transformed, subtracting minC1. If maximization were performed,
% %one would have to subtract the maximum entry in C1.
% 
% CD=Inf(numTar,numTar);
% CD(diagElIdx(numTar))=missedDetect;

%     if(rowNum>numMeas)
%         rowNum=1;
%     else

%     tuplesAlt(:,curCol)=[rowNum;curCol];
% end
% all(tuples(:)==tuplesAlt(:))
% all(gainAlt==gain)
%One will see that both of the above are 1, demonstrating that both

function [wAbs,wOrd,col4row]=lexBottleneckAssign(C)
%%LEXBOTTLENECKASSIGN Solve the lexicographic bottleneck assignment problem
%          for a square cost matrix. A linear bottleneck assignment
%          problem can be formulated as
%          gain=minimize_phi max_i C_{i,phi(i)} where phi is a permutation
%                                               vector.
%          It can also be formulated as:
%          gain=minimize_{x} max_{i,j} C_{i,j}*x_{i,j}
%          subject to
%          \sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{i,j}=1 for all i
%          \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i,j}=1 for all j
%          x_{i,j}=0 or 1. Let the vector w be the vector of elements
%          C(i,phi(i)) sorted  in decreasing order. The lexicographic
%          lexicographic bottleneck problem solves the bottleneck problem
%          and produces a w that is lexicographically the minimum among all
%          possible w vectors. Note that gain=w(1).
%
%INPUTS: C An nXn cost matrix that does not contain any NaNs.
%
%OUTPUTS: wAbs The lexicographically minimal w vector. The elements are in
%              descending order.
%         wOrd The lexicographically minimal w vector given in terms of the
%              order statistics of the elements in C by magnitude. Thus, 0
%              is the minimum element in C, 1 is the second largest, etc.
%      col4row An nX1 vector where the entry in each element is an
%              assignment of the element in that row to a column. This is
%              equivalent to phi above.
%
%This function implements Algorithm 6.7 of Chapter 6.6 of [1]. A possibly
%faster technique is also described in the text of the Chapter.
%
%EXAMPLE 1:
%This is Example 6.2.4 in Chapter 6.6 of [1]. We compare the lexicographic
%bottleneck assignment problem solution to a generic bottleneck assignment
%problem solution.
% C=[8,9,3,2;
%    4,7,3,8;
%    0,8,10,4;
%    2,5,8,3];
% wAbsLex=lexBottleneckAssign(C);
% col4row=linBottleneckAssign(C);
% %Next, extract the  vector such that wAbs(k) is the kth largest cost in C
% %that is in the solution from linBottleneckAssign.
% n=size(C,1);
% wAbs=zeros(n,1);
% for i=1:n
%     j=col4row(i);
%     wAbs(i)=C(i,j);
% end
% wAbs=sort(wAbs,'descend');
% wAbsLex
% wAbs
%One sees that the ordered selected elements on wAbsLex have a lower
%lexicographic order than those of wAbs. wAbsLex is [5;3;2;0] and wAbs is
%[5;4;4;3].

 * function prepares the input and then calls this function.
 * Unlike assign2D, this function has an additional input called
 * numCol4Gain, which is useful when this function is used to start Murty's
 * algorithm for the k-best hypotheses. numCol4Gain is the number of
 * columns used when computing the gain. Normally, this will be the same as
 * numCol, but if the matrix was padded for use in a k-best assignment
 * algorithm, then this will be less than the gain.
 * 
 * The result is placed in workMem. the return value is 1 if the problem is
 * infeasible; otherwise it is zero. If the problem is infeasible, then the
 * gain in problemSol is set to -1.

function [col4rowBest,row4colBest,gainBest]=kBest2DAssign(C,k,maximize)
%%KBEST2DASSIGN Find the k lowest (or highest) cost 2D assignments for the
%               two-dimensional assignment problem with a rectangular cost
%               matrix C.
%
%INPUTS: C A numRowXnumCol cost matrix that does not contain any NaNs and
%          where the largest finite element minus the smallest element is a
%          finite quantity (does not overflow) when performing minimization
%          and where the smallest finite element minus the largest element
%          is finite when performing maximization. Forbidden assignments
%          can be given costs of +Inf for minimization and -Inf for
%          maximization.
%        k The number >=1 of hypotheses to generate. If k is less than the
%          total number of unique hypotheses, then all possible hypotheses
%          will be returned.
% maximize If true, the minimization problem is transformed into a
%          maximization problem. The default if this parameter is omitted
%          is false.
%
%OUTPUTS: col4rowBest A numRowXk vector where the entry in each element
%                     is an assignment of the element in that row to a
%                     column. 0 entries signify unassigned rows.
%         row4colbest A numColXk vector where the entry in each element
%                     is an assignment of the element in that column to a
%                     row. 0 entries signify unassigned columns.
%            gainBest A kX1 vector containing the sum of the values of the
%                     assigned elements in C for all of the hypotheses.

%
%This is an implementation of Murty's method, which is described in [1].
%The algorithm relies on the existence of a 2D assignment algorithm. The 2D
%assignment algorithm of [2] is used. Additionally, the dual variable
%inheritance methods described in [3] is used to reduce the computational
%complexity of the technique.
%
%Murty's algorithm runs 2D assignment algorithms a number of times with an
%increasing number of constraints. Much of the assignment code is in the
%handle subclass MurtyData. Instances of MurtyData are stored in an ordered
%list implemented using the BinaryHeap class.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This is the example used in [1]. We show how to turn the col4row and
%row4col outputs into the tuples as shown in the paper.

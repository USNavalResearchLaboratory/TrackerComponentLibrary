function [minCostTuples,gain]=assign3DBB(C,maximize,boundType,initMethod,maxIter,epsVal)
%%ASSIGN3DBB Solve the data fusion axial 3D assignment problem using a
%         branch-and-bound algorithm. Such problems are NP-hard and thus
%         cannot be solved in polynomial time, so this function can only
%         solve problems of a moderate size. The optimization problem being
%         solved is minimize (or maximize)
%         \sum_{i=1}^{n1}\sum_{j=1}^{n2}\sum_{k=1}^{n3}C_{i,j,k}*\rho_{i,j,k}
%         subject to
%         \sum_{i=1}^{n1}\sum_{j=1}^{n2}\rho_{i,j,k}<=1 for all k
%         \sum_{i=1}^{n1}\sum_{k=1}^{n3}\rho_{i,j,k}<=1 for all j
%         \sum_{j=1}^{n2}\sum_{k=1}^{n3}\rho_{i,j,k} =1 for all i
%         \rho_{i,j,k} = 0 or 1
%         assuming that n1<=n2<=n3, and C is and n1Xn2Xn3 cost matrix.
%         This is equivalent to the optimization problem
%         min (or max) sum_{i} C(i,phi_2(i),phi_3(i))
%         where phi_2 and phi_3 are length n1 arrangements of n2 and n3
%         items over which the minimization is performed. In general, it is
%         not required that n1<=n2<=n3 (for any other ordering, the
%         equality constraint is on the dimension with the fewest
%         elements), so the solution is given as tuples solving the problem
%         min (or max) sum_{i} C(tuple(1,i),tuple(2,i),tuple(3,i))
%         where the tuples satisfy all of the above constraints.
%
%INPUTS: C An n1Xn2Xn3 cost hypermatrix. C cannot contain any NaNs and the
%          largest finite element minus the smallest element is a finite
%          quantity (does not overflow) when performing minimization and
%          where the smallest finite element minus the largest element is
%          finite when performing maximization.  Forbidden assignments can
%          be given costs of +Inf for minimization and -Inf for
%          maximization. During minimization, there should be no elements
%          with -Inf cost and no elements with +Inf cost during
%          maximization.
% maximize If true, the minimization problem is transformed into a
%          maximization problem. The default if this parameter is omitted
%          or an empty matrix is passed is false.
% boundType This selects the bound to use for the branch and bound method.
%          These correspond to the method input of the assign3DLB function.
%          The default if this parameter is omitted or an empty matrix is
%          passed is 2.
% initMethod A parameter indicating how the branch-and-bound algorithm
%          should be initialized. Possible values are:
%          0 (The default if omitted or an empty matrix is passed) Do not
%            use an initial estimate.
%          1 Use an initial solution (and lower bound) via algorithm 0 of
%            the assign3D function.
%  maxIter If initMethod=1, then this is the maximum number of iterations
%          to allow the initialization routine in assign3D to perform. If
%          initMethod~=1, then this parameter is ignored. The default if
%          omitted or an empty matrix is passed is 10.
%   epsVal If initMethod=1, then this is both the AbsTold and RelTol inputs
%          to assign3D to determine whether the function has converged in
%          terms of the relative duality gap. If initMethod~=1, then this
%          parameter is ignored. The default if omitted or an empty matrix
%          is passed is eps(1).
%
%OUTPUTS: tuples A 3Xn1 matrix where tuples(:,i) is the ith assigned tuple
%                in C as described above.
%           gain The cost value of the optimal assignment found. This is
%                the sum of the values of the assigned elements in C.
%
%The algorithm is similar to the branch-and bound procedure describes in
%[1], which uses the "classical" branching of [2]. There is a total of
%min([n1,n2,n3]) elements to choose out of the entire C matrix. Suppose
%that n1=min([n1,n2,n3]). Then, the tuples chosen will have the first index
%from 1 to n1 and the indices of the remaining two tuple components will
%vary. The branching here is on the tuple chosen for i=1 of C(i,j,k), then
%the next level is for i=2 until branching is done for i=n1. At each level
%of branching there are n2*n3 possibilities, as is illustrated in Fig. 1 of
%[1]. Each time a branch is taken, all tuples of (j,k) sharing any common
%tuples with the branch taken (and any previous branches taken) must be
%removed. At each level, lower bounds for all n2*n3 possible branches are
%computed. Those branches with lower bounds that are less than the best
%found solution are discarded.

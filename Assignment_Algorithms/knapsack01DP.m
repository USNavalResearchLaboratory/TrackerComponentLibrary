%%KNAPSACK01DP Solve the 0-1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
%        The 0-1 knapsack problem is to find a subset sel of the items in v
%        that solves the optimization problem
%        max_{sel} sum(v(sel))
%        such that sum(w(sel))<=W
%        This can be thought of as fitting the most things in a knapsack if
%        the v's are all 1's, the w's are the sizes of things and W is the
%        capacity of the knapsack.
%
%INPUTS: v An nX1 or 1Xn vector of positive real values to maximize.
%        w An nX1 or 1Xn vector of positive integer capacities required for
%          each value.
%        W The positive integer maximum allowable capacity that can be
%          filled.
%
%OUTPUTS: valuesSelected The indices of the items in v (and w) that are
%                  selected. If the problem is infeasible, then an empty
%                  matrix is returned.
%          costVal The sum of the selected items in v. 0 is returned if the
%                  problem is infeasible.
%
%The knapsack problem is NP-hard. The complexity of this algorithm
%scaled with W. It is O(n*W) The algorithm is solved via dynamic
%programming. A development of the recursion in such a dynamic programming
%approach is given in Chapter 5.4 of [1]. However, this is a very common
%method for solving this problem and thus solutions can be found in a
%number of basic textbooks on algorithms.
%
%EXAMPLE:
% W=7;
% v=[2.1;3.125;66;4.3;6.2];
% w=[1;2;3;4;5];
% [valuesSelected,costVal]=knapsack01DP(v,w,W)
%One will get values 3, 2, and 1 selected.

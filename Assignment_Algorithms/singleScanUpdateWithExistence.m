%%SINGLESCANUPDATEWITHEXISTENCE Perform the measurement update step in a
%                  single-scan tracking algorithm that uses Gaussian  
%                  approximations to represent the target state before and
%                  after the measurement update given a matrix of
%                  likelihoods and a set of track update hypotheses as well
%                  as probabilities that the targets actually exist. This
%                  is essentially the update step in a type of Joint
%                  Integrated Probabilistic Data Association Filter
%                  (JIPDAF), except different options for the algorithms
%                  allow it to also apply to a JIPDAF* as well as other
%                  variant filters. In all instances, it is assumed that
%                  each measurement can be assigned to at most one target,
%                  and each target can be assigned to at most one
%                  measurement.
%
%INPUTS: xHyp An xDimXnumTarXnumHyp set of track states updated with each
%              of the (numHyp-1) measurements for each of the numTar
%              targets, with the last hypothesis being the update for the
%              missed detection hypothesis. The order of the measurement
%              hypotheses is the same as the ordering of the likelihoods in
%              the columns of the A matrix.
%         PHyp An xDimXxDimXnumTarXnumHyp set of covariance matrices for
%              each of the track states for each of the targets updated
%              conditioned on each of the numHyp measurements with the last
%              one being for the missed detection hypothesis.
%           PD The a priori detection probabilities of the targets given
%              that they exist. This can either be a numTarX1 vector if the
%              targets have different detection probabilities. Otherwise,
%              this can be a scalar value if all targets have the same
%              detection probability.
%        rPred A numTarX1 vector of the predicted probabilities of target
%              existence.
%           A  A matrix of positive likelihoods or likelihood ratios (NOT
%              log-likelihood ratios). A is a numTarX(numMeas+numTar)
%              matrix of all-positive likelihoods or likelihood ratios for
%              assigning the target specified by the row to the measurement
%              specified by the column. Columns > numMeas hold
%              missed-detection likelihoods. Thus, off-diagonal terms for
%              columns > numMeas should be set to 0 and the diagonal terms
%              set to the costs of a missed detection for each given
%              target. These are computed as one would for the input to the
%              function singleScanUpdate,except to deal with the likelihood
%              of a target's non-existence, all occurences of the detection
%              probability must be multiplied by the probability that the
%              target exists (the appropriate entry in rHyp). For example,
%              a typical missed detection likelihood ratio for the ith
%              target might be 1-Pd*rHyp(i). where PD is the detection
%              probability. The function makeStandardCartOnlyLRMatHyps can
%              be used to make such likelihood ratio matrices in certain
%              Gaussian/Cartesian problems.
%      algSel1 An optional parameter that selects the assignment algorithm
%              to use. Approximate variants of the algorithms also use
%              algSel2. If this parameter and the next parameter are both
%              omitted, then the algorithm is chosen as described below.
%              Possible values are
%              0) GNN-JIPDA
%              1) JIPDA
%              2) JIPDA*
%              3) Approximate GNN-JIPDA
%              4) Approximate JIPDA
%              5) Naive nearest neighbor JIPDA.
%              6) Approximate naïve nearest neighbor JIPDA.
%      algSel2 An optional parameter that further specifies the algorithm
%              used when algSel1=3,4. If omitted but algSel1 is specified,
%              a default value of 0 is used. If both algSel1 and algSel2
%              are omitted, the algorithm is chosen as described below.
%              algSel2 chooses the approximation for the beta terms in the
%              function calc2DAssignmentProbsApprox (the approxType input)
%              when using algSel1=3,4; the comments to that function
%              describe the values it can take.
%       param3 For the case where algSel1=3,4 and algSel2=0, this is the
%              optional delta input to the function
%              calc2DAssignmentProbsApprox. If omitted or an empty matrix
%              is passed, the default value for that function is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: xUpdate An xDimXnumTar matrix of updated target states.
%         PUpdate An xDimXxDimXnumtar matrix of updated covariance matrices
%                 for the targets.
%         rUpdate A numTarX1 set of updated probabilities of target
%                 existence.
% probNonTargetMeas A numMeasX1 set of posterior probabilities that the
%                 measurements do not come from any of the known targets.
%                 These probabilities play a role in track initiation.
% dominantMeasIdx A numTarX1 vector which indicates the index of the
%                 dominant measurement updating each target. Zero is used
%                 for the missed detection hypothesis. For hard assignment
%                 algorithms, this is the measurement assigned. For soft
%                 assignment algorithms, this is the highest probability
%                 measurement for each target.
%
%This function basically implements the measurement update step for the
%JIPDAF (and related filters), updating the known targets, their existence
%probabilities, and providing probabilities of the measurements being from
%new tracks. The JIPDAF is described in [1].
%
%The JIPDAF is essentially a JPDAF which also updates probabilities of
%target existence. rPred is a vector of prior target existence
%probabiltiies. The target existence probability update given measurements
%is given in Equation 9.14 of Chapter 9 of [2]. If betas(:,1:(end-1)) holds
%posterior target-measurement association probabilities for known targets
%and betas(:,end) is the set of probabilities that the targets either were
%not detected or do not exist, then the update for the probability of
%target existence is derived as
% P(exists|Z)=P(exists and observed|Z)+P(exists and not observed |Z)
% Well, P(exists and observed|Z) is just sum(betas(:,1:(end-1)),2)
% On the other hand
% P(exists and not observed |Z)=P(exists|Z,not observed)*P(not observed|Z)
% Well, P(not observed|Z)=betas(:,end)
% That leaves 
% P(exists|Z,not observed)=P(exists|not observed)=P(exists and not observed)/P(not observed)
% Well,
% P(exists and not observed)=P(not observed|exists)*P(exists)=(1-PD)*rPred
% and similarly,
% P(not observed)=1-P(observed|exists)*P(exists)=1-PD*rPred
%
%Next, the other difference is in the computation of the target-measurement
%association probabilities. Here, it is simpler to look at [3], where the 
%Track-Oriented Marginal Multiple Target Multi-Bernoulli-Poisson (TOMB/P)
%filter is presented. As discussed in Section IV-A of [3], the TOMB/P
%filter differs from the JIPDA only in that it includes an extra term to
%account for "undetected targets" that one is modeling based on there being
%an expected number of targets present. Removing that term from Equation 68
%of [3], the result is identical to the association probability computation
%in the JPDAF, except one multiplied PD (the a priori detection
%probability) by rPred, the a priori target existence probability. Thus,
%one can use all of the methods available for computing and approximating
%target-measurement association probabilities in the JPDAF. Thus, the
%implementation of the JIPDAF*, which is derived in [4], requires nothing
%special compared to the standard JPDAF*.
%
%After using this function to perform a measurement update, one will
%typically use one-point differencing on all of the measurements to create
%potential new track hypotheses. The initial probabilities of these
%hypotheses are usually taken to be the posterior probability that the
%measurement is not from a known target times another value. Thus, this
%function returns those probabilities for later use. In Equation
%9.14 in Ch. 9.4.1 of [2], the value by which the posterior non-target
%measurement probabilities are multiplied is just taken to be an ad-hoc
%design parameter. This is probably the best way to go. Equation 9.13 of
%Ch. 9.4.1 of [2] and Eq. 69 of [3] take this other value to be something
%based on an assumes spatial density of new objects being discovered.
%
%The prediction step in filtering using such target existence probabilities
%is exactly the same as in any other single-Gaussian filter except the
%existence probabilities rUpdate are typically multiplied by a transition
%probability (to go from existence to non-existence) before the next
%update. This value is a design parameter.
%
%Note that the type of integrated tracking filter described here
%corresponds to one using Markov Chain 1 in [1]. The other option contains
%both probabilities that the target exists as well as probabilities that
%the target is just not visible at all (but still exists).

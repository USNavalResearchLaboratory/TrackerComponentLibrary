function beta=calcStarBetasBF(A)
%%CALCSTARBETASBF Calculate target-measurement association probabilities,
%                 as in the JPDAF* given an association matrix using a
%                 brute-force method.                
%
%INPUTS: A A matrix of positive likelihoods or likelihood ratios (NOT log-
%          likelihood ratios). A is a numTar X (numMeas+numTar) matrix of
%          all-positive likelihoods or likelihood ratios for assigning the
%          target specified by the row to the measurement specified by the
%          column. Columns > numMeas hold missed-detection likelihoods.
%          Thus, off-diagonal terms for columns > numMeas should be set to
%          0 and the diagonal terms set to the costs of a missed detection
%          for each given target. NOTE: The missed detection hypotheses
%          cannot have zero likelihood.
%
%OUTPUTS: beta A numTar X (numMeas+1) matrix of probabilities of assigning
%              the target given by the row to the measurement given by the
%              column. The final column is a set of missed detection
%              probabilities.
%
%The JPDAF* is the same as the JPDAF except certain joint association
%events are thrown out. The JPDAF* is originally from [1].

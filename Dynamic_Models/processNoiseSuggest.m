%%PROCESSNOISESUGGEST Use one of a number methods for choosing the scaling
%             parameter for the process noise covariance in a number of
%             continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic models. This only
%             provides the scaling parameter for one dimension of motion.
%             In a multidimensional system, if the measurement noise
%             variance varies between dimensions (such as tracking in range
%             and angle with a range-angle state), then one might use
%             different values in different dimensions. The method only
%             considers scalar measurements in the respective dimensions
%             and is thus only good for a rough approximation.
%
%INPUTS: algorithm A string specifying the algorithm and model used to
%           estimate a good process noise parameter. Possible values are:

%                                QPolyKalDirectAlt function. This covers

%                 'DWNA-OptMMSE' Use the method of Blair for determining

%               'DWNA-ConstMeas' Use the method of Blair for determining
%                                the asymptotically optimal value of
%                                sigmaV2 for the DWNA model such that
%                                the MSE of a Kalman filter under a maximum
%                                acceleration maneuver is not worse than
%                                the measurement accuracy.
%    maxVal All of the methods require a maximum bound related to how the
%           target can maneuver. For algorithms CWNA-OptMMSE,
%           DWNA-OptMMSE, CWNA-ConstMeas, and DWNA-ConstMeas, maxVal is
%           the maximum acceleration of the target. For PolyKal-ROT and
%           PolyKalDirectDisc-ROT, and PolyKalDirectAlt-ROT maxVal is the
%           maximum value of a moment one order higher than the maximum
%           order of the dynamic model. For example, if order=1, then
%           maxVal is a maximum acceleration.  If order=2, then maxVal is
%           a maximum jerk.
%         T For all of the algorithms except PolyKalDirectDisc-ROT, this
%           parameter is required and is the typical time between
%           measurements of the target.
%   sigmaw2 For algorithms CWNA-OptMMSE, DWNA-OptMMSE, CWNA-ConstMeas, and
%           DWNA-ConstMeas, this parameter is required and is the variance
%           of the 1D measurement, which should be the lowest order moment
%           of the state. In other words, position.
%    manDur For algorithms CWNA-OptMMSE, DWNA-OptMMSE, CWNA-ConstMeas, and
%           DWNA-ConstMeas, this parameter is required and is the
%           maximum number of samples of duration T that a maximum
%           acceleration maneuver is expected to take. This can take
%           values, 3, 4, 5, 6 and infinity.
%
%OUTPUTS: procNoiseParam The value of q0 or sigmaV2 for the specified
%                        dynamic model, chosen according to the selected
%                        ad-hoc parameter.
%
%The output of this function goes into functions like QPolyKal. It is meant
%that one computes the process noise parameter once (for QPolyKal, this
%would correspond to the q0 parameter), and then one calls the other
%functions with different samples prediction intervals. This function
%should not be called to change the process noise parameter as the sampling
%period changes.
%
%All of the rule-of-thumb methods for choosing the process noise values are
%from Chapter 6.2 and 6.3 of [1] and modified slightly, as described in the
%comments for the implementation below.
%
%The solutions for the ConstMeas and MMSE methods are from [2],
%which is an extension of the work in [3] and [4].
%
%The rule-of thumb parameters might be suitable for other dynamic models.
%For example, when using the Singer model, given with aGaussMarkov and
%DPoly in continuous-time and with FGaussMarkov and QGaussMarkov in
%discrete-time, there does not appear to be a clear way to set the scaling
%value for the process noise in the literature. However, if tau=infinity in
%the model, then in continuous time, it reduces to the CWPA model. Thus,
%methods for choosing the process noise parameter in the CWPA and the DCWPA
%models might be good starting points for setting the process noise
%parameter in the continuous and discrete Singer models.

        %the CWNA, DCWNA, CWPA and DCWPA. For the CWNA and DCWNA models, it
        %is suggested that sqrt(q0*T) be on the order of the changes in
        %velocity over a sampling interval. In other words, it is the
        %average acceleration. It might be more useful to express things in
        %terms of a maximum acceleration, though. In Chapter 6.3.2 for the
        %DWNA model, it is suggested that  0.5*aMax<=sigmaV<=aMax. Using a
        %similar logic, one might try  0.5*aMax<=sqrt(q0*T)<=aMax. Using
        %the same logic for the CWPA and DCWPA models of Chapter 6.2.3, one

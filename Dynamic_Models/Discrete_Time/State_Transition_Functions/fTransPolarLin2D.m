function xPred=fTransPolarLin2D(T,x,qTheta)
%%FTRANSPOLARLIN2D Evaluate a discrete-time state transition function for a
%                  constant-heading 2D dynamic model where the target state
%                  is given in term of position, the direction of the
%                  velocity measured counterclockwise from the x-axis, and
%                  speed. Optionally, a speed derivative component can be
%                  given to model possible linear target acceleration. This
%                  function can be useful for state prediction using the
%                  Cubature Kalman filter.
%
%INPUTS: T  The time-duration of the propagation interval in seconds.
%        x  The 4XN or 5XN set of N target state vectors in 2D space in the
%           order of [2D position;direction angle;speed; speed derivative]
%           where the heading angle is measured in radians counterclockwise
%           from the x axis and the speed derivative is akin to an
%           acceleration. If a speed derivative is not given (is assumed
%           zero), then x is 4XN.
%   qTheta  If the transition function from a second-order weak
%           Ito-Taylor expansion is desired, then qTheta must be provided.
%           qTheta is the power spectral density of the process noise
%           corrupting the angular component of the state, having units of
%           radians^2/s. If qTheta is omitted, then the transition function
%           obtained by holding the nonlinear components constant over the
%           prediction interval is provided.
%
%OUTPUTS: xPred The 4XN or 5XN set of N state vectors after being predicted
%               forward a duration of T in time using the method depending
%               on whether qTheta is provided.
%
%The solution using a second-order weak Ito-Taylor expansion is taken from
%[1].
%
%The discretized model is inspired from a discussion in [2], where a
%different definition of heading direction is used. The expression comes
%from the limit of a turning model as the turn rates goes to zero.
%
%However, the discretized model can be derived from first principles based
%on the principles in Chapter 6 of [3], where a matrix exponential is used.
%
%The associated state prediction covariance matrix can be obtained using
%QPolarLin2D. The associated state transition matrix, which can be useful
%if one wants to directly use a Kalman filter, can be obtained from
%FPolarLin2D.

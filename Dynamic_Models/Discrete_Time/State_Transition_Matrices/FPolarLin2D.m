function F=FPolarLin2D(T,x,qTheta)
%%FPOLARLIN2D Obtain the discrete-time state transition matrix for
%             a constant-heading 2D dynamic model where the target state is
%             given in terms of position, the direction of the velocity
%             measured counterclockwise from the x-axis and speed.
%             Optionally, a speed derivative component can be given to
%             model possible linear target acceleration. The matrix can be
%             obtained from a linearization or from a second-order weak
%             Ito-Taylor expansion.
%
%INPUTS: T  The time-duration of the propagation interval in seconds.
%        x  The 4X1 or 5X1 target state vector in 2D space in the order of
%           [2D position;direction angle;speed; speed derivative] where the
%           heading angle is measured in radians counterclockwise from the
%           x axis and the speed derivative is akin to an acceleration. If
%           a speed derivative is not given (is assumed zero), then x is
%           4X1.
%    qTheta If the state transition matrix from a second-order weak
%           Ito-Taylor expansion is desired, then qTheta must be provided.
%           qTheta is the power spectral density of the process noise
%           corrupting the angular component of the state, having units of
%           radians^2/s. If qTheta is omitted, then the discrete-time state
%           transition matrix obtained by holding the nonlinear components
%           constant is provided.
%
%OUTPUTS: F The state transition matrix under a discrete-time linear motion
%           model where the target state is given in terms of position,
%           heading, speed, and optionally, linear acceleration.
%
%The state transition matrix without acceleration is the same as the matrix
%for the turning model as taken from the unnumered transition equation
%after equation 1b in [1], which comes from the initial derivation in [2],
%where a different definition of heading direction is used. The expression
%comes from the limit of a turning model as the turn rates goes to zero.
%
%However, the discretized model can be derived from first principles based
%on the principles in Chapter 6 of [3], where a matrix exponential is used.
%
%The solution using a second-order weak Ito-Taylor expansion is taken from
%[4].
%
%The associated state prediction covariance matrix can be obtained using
%QPolarLin2D. The associated nonlinear transition function, which is useful
%if one wishes to use the Cubature Kalman filter for the prediction step,
%is fTransPolarLin2D.

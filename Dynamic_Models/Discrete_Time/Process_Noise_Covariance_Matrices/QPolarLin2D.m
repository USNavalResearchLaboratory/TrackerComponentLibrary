function Q=QPolarLin2D(T,x,qTheta,param4,type)
%QPOLARLIN2D  Obtain the discrete-time state process noise covariance
%             matrix for a constant-heading 2D dynamic model where the
%             target state is given in terms of position, the direction of
%             the velocity measured counterclockwise from the x-axis and
%             speed. Optionally, a speed derivative component can be given
%             to model possible linear target acceleration. The matrix can
%             be obtained from a linearization or from a second-order weak
%             It√¥-Taylor expansion.
%
%INPUTS: T The time-duration of the propagation interval in seconds.
%        x The 4X1 or 5X1 target state vector in 2D space in the order of
%          [2D position;direction angle;speed; speed derivative] where the
%          heading angle is measured in radians counterclockwise from the
%          x axis and the speed derivative is akin to an acceleration. If
%          a speed derivative is not given (is assumed zero), then x is
%          4X1.
%   qTheta The power spectral density of the process noise corrupting the
%          angular component of the state, having units of radians^2/s.
%   param4 Depending on the dimensionality of x, this is either the power
%          spectral density of the process noise corrupting the speed
%          (when x is 4X1), having units of m^2/s^3, or this is the power
%          spectral density of the linear acceleration, having units of
%          m^2/s^3.
%     type An optional parameter specifying the type of linearization used
%          to obtain the process noise covariance matrix. This can be
%          either
%          'Discretized' (The default if omitted), treat the nonlinear
%                       terms in the drift matrix as constant and solve
%                       for the state transition equation. Note that Q is
%                       always singular when using the discretized model.
%          'ItoTaylorO2Weak' Use an order 2.0 weak Ito Taylor expansion.
%                       This provides better results than the simple
%                       linear expansion. Note that Q is singular when
%                       using the weak Ito-Taylor expansion with linear
%                       acceleration in the model. Q is (generally) not
%                       singular when a linear acceleration is not used.
%
%OUTPUT: Q The process noise covariance matrix under a linear dynamic
%          model, possibly with linear acceleration.
%
%The solution using a second-order weak Ito-Taylor expansion is taken from
%[1].
%
%The discretized model is inspired from a discussion in [2], where a
%different definition of heading direction is used. The expression comes
%from the limit of a turning model as the turn rates goes to zero.
%
%However, the discretized model can be derived from first principles based
%on the principles in Chapter 6 of [3], where a matrix exponential is used.
%
%The associated state transition matrix can be obtained using
%FPolarLin2D. The associated state transition function, which can be useful
%in some Cubature Kalman filter implementation, is fTransPolarLin2D.

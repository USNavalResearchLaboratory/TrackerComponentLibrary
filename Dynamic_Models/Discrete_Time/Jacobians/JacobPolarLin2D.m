function J=JacobPolarLin2D(T,x,qTheta)
%%JACOBPOLARLIN2D Evaluate the Jacobian (matrix of partial derivatives with
%                 respect to the state elements) of a discrete-time state
%                 transition function for a constant-heading 2D dynamic
%                 model where the target state is given in term of
%                 position, the direction of the velocity measured
%                 counterclockwise from the x-axis, and speed. Optionally,
%                 a speed derivative component can be given to model
%                 possible linear target acceleration. This provides the
%                 Jacobian corresponding to the state transition function
%                 fTransPolarLin2D.
%
%INPUTS: x  The 4X1 or 5X1 target state vector in 2D space in the
%           order of [2D position;direction angle;speed; speed derivative]
%           where the heading angle is measured in radians counterclockwise
%           from the x axis and the speed derivative is akin to an
%           acceleration. If a speed derivative is not given (is assumed
%           zero), then x is 4X1.
%        T  The time-duration of the propagation interval in seconds.
%    qTheta If the transition function from a second-order weak
%           Ito-Taylor expansion is desired, then qTheta must be provided.
%           qTheta is the power spectral density of the process noise
%           corrupting the angular component of the state, having units of
%           radians^2/s. If qTheta is omitted, then the transition function
%           obtained by holding the nonlinear components constant over the
%           prediction interval is provided.
%
%OUTPUTS: J The 4X4 or 5X5 Jacobian matrix of the function
%           fTransPolarLin2D, where the partial derivatives are ordered
%           [df/dx(1), df/dx(2),...,df/dx(xDim)]. That is, column i
%           consists of partial derivatives with respect to element i of
%           the x vector.
%
%More comments on the model are given in the function fTransPolarLin2D.

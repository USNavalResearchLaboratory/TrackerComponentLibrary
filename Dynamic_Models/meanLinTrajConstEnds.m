function [x,t]=meanLinTrajConstEnds(x0,x2,deltaT,q0,order,N,FFun,QFun)
%%MEANLINTRAJCONSTENDS Generate a the mean trajectory based on a linear
%               dynamic model with additive noise, as is typically used in
%               tracking systems, given known locations of the start and
%               end points. A polynomial dynamic model is used by default,
%               but one can specify other models.
%
%INPUTS: x0, x2 The xDimX1 target states at the beginning and end of the
%               region over which paths are to be simulated. These are
%               treated as known values.
%        deltaT The time between when state x0 occurred and when state x2
%               occurred. This is a positive value.
%            q0 The power spectral density of the process noise. This is
%               passed to QFun, as described below and by default would
%               corresponds to the same-named input in QPolyKal. With the
%               default polynomial dynamic model, FPolyKal and QPolyKal, q0
%               has no effect on the result and is just set to 1 if an
%               empty matrix is passed.
%         order The order >=0 of the filter. If order=1, then it is
%               constant velocity, 2 means constant acceleration, 3 means
%               constant jerk, etc. This is passed to FFun and QFun. If
%               custom FFun and QFun functions are used and this is not
%               needed, then an empty matrix can be passed. The default if
%               omitted or an empty matrix is passed is 1.
%             N The number of points in the random path to generate between
%               x0 and x2. The default if omitted or an empty matrix is
%               passed is 100; N>=0.
%    FFun, QFun Optional function handles to functions that respectively
%               provide the state transition matrix and the process noise
%               covariance matrix as a function of the time duration over
%               which the prediction is taken. The defaults if omitted or
%               empty matrices are passed are handles to FPolyKal and
%               QPolyKal. The functions are called as FFun(T,xDim,order)
%               and QFun(T,xDim,order,q0), where T is the duration over
%               which the prediction is taken.
%
%OUTPUTS: x The xDimX(N+2) set of mean trajectory according to the
%           specified model. x(:,1) is always x0 and x(:,N+2) is always x2.
%         t The (N+2)X1 set of time offsets (starting at 0) where the
%           values in x are generated.
%
%Consider a process at points 0, 1, and 2, where we are given the value at
%time x0. The transition models are:
%x1=F0*x0+w1
%x2=F1*x1+w2
%Where x0 is given (deterministic) and w1 and w2 are independent zero-mean
%Gaussian random variables with covariance matrices Q1 and Q1.
%x1 and x2 are jointly normal with mean mu and covariance matrix Sigma:
%mu=[x1Pred; = [F0*x0
%    x2Pred]    F1*F0*x0];
%Sigma=[   Q1,        Q1*F1'; =[Pxx, Pxz;
%       F1*Q1,  F1*Q1*F1'+Q2]   Pxz',Pzz];
%When given the value of x2, the conditional distribution of x1|x0,x2 is
%the same as the Kalman filter update taking the measurement covariance
%matrix to be Q2, the measurement matrix H to be F1, the prior state to be
%F0*x0, and the covariance of the prior state to be Q1. Thus, as derived,
%for example, in [Ch. 5,1], [2], the posterior distribution of x1 is
%Gaussian with mean and covariance matrix
%x1Bar=x1Pred+Pxz/Pzz*(x2-x2Pred)
%This function is similar to randLinTrajConstEnds.
%
%EXAMPLE:
%This plots a trajectory that eventually has to turn around, since the
%endpoint is not close to the direction of the initial velocity vector.
% x0=[1e3;0;30;20];
% x2=[709;

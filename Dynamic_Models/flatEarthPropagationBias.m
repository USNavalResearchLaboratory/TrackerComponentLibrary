function vertBias=flatEarthPropagationBias(predDist,r)
%%FLATEARTHPROPAGATIONBIAS This is the vertical offset bias present when
%           predicting a constant-altitude target forward in a local
%           tangent plane versus compensating for the curvature of a
%           spherical Earth. This does not include horizontal biases. This
%           can be useful for determining when flat-Earth biases might
%           become significant.
%
%INPUTS: predDist The distance forward in the local tangent plant that one
%                 wishes to travel without compensating for the Earth's
%                 curvature. This can be a vector or matrix if one wishes
%                 to find the bias at multiple distances at once.
%               r The radius of the spherical Earth. If this parameter is
%                 omitted or an empty matrix is passed, then the default of
%                 Constants.WGS84MeanRadius is used.
%
%OUTPUTS: vertBias The magnitude of the vertical height bias. THis is the
%                  same size as predDist.
%
%This implements Equation 58 in [1].
